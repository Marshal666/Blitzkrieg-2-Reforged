	<Text>Naval Intelligence seems to believe that the Japanese have landed more motorized infantry on Guadalcanal, reinforcing their hold on the southern edge of the island. We&apos;ve sent a Marine rifle company to stop them from getting behind our linesâ€¦ but because the Navy has yet to achieve control of the seas around this miserable island, the Japanese could move in more troops at any time, enough to start outflanking us. Use our air assets to locate the enemy convoy, and then bomb the hell out of it. </Text>
