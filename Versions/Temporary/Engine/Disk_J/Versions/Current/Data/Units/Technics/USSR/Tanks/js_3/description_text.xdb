	<Text>The last Soviet war-time design. This heavy tank differed from the IS2 by the new shapes of the body and turret; it also had varied armour, depending on the various sections&apos; hit probability. Mass production of the IS3 began in April - May, 1945, so it didn&apos;t take part in action against Germany (though the Germans claimed to destroy several such machines). For the first time IS3 was presented on September 7, 1945 during the parade to celebrate the end of the WW2. Altogether about 11,700 such tanks were made.</Text>
