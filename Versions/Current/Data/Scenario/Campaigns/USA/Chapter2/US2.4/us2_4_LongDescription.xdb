	<Text>As you are aware, our forces have captured and improved the Japanese airstrip on Guadalcanal and renamed it Henderson Field. This is the only air facility on Guadalcanal, and we must maintain control of it, especially with the entire Jap military converging on the Solomon Islands area. Without a friendly airbase in the area, we&apos;ll have to rely on the Navy for air support even as they&apos;re trying to fight off the Japanese fleet. Henderson Field is indispensableâ€¦ you&apos;re to hold it at all costs.</Text>
