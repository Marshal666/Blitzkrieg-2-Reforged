	<Text>A strong Jap force of infantry and armor is coming to recapture Henderson Field from us. Every grunt, Marine, and Seabee who can pull a trigger will be issued a rifle and ordered to stand a post. The enemy must not capture the airfield! How to stop them is completely at your discretion.  Not to humble you, but the future of the war in the Pacific may be in your hands. </Text>
