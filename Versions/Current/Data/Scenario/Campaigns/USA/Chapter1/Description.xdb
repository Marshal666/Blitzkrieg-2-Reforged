	<Text>After the devastating airstrikes against the American Pacific fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor, the full might of Imperial Japan fell upon the outlying outposts of the Americans and British in the Western Pacific. The American forces in the Phillipines, vulnerable to attack without a strong naval presence to guard the oceans, is in dire need of supplies and reinforcements but is unlikely to receive any. Thus it behooves the American commanders to maximize their situation as best they can, in spite of an enemy blockade and overwhelming air superiority. Can you delay the Japanese invaders for six months or longer?</Text>
