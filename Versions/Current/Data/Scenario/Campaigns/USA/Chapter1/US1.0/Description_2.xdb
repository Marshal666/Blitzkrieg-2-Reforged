	<Text>We rescued one of our airmen who claims he spotted Japanese troops moving south inland of the coast… if that&apos;s true, they&apos;ll be in contact with your right flank any minute. I&apos;ve asked HQ for reinforcements… there aren&apos;t any. No word from Pearl Harbor on that supply convoy, either. Maybe it&apos;s bad and getting worse, but for right now just hold those forward objectives.</Text>
