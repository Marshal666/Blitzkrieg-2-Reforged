	<Text>More bad news. The Japanese have captured Singapore and have invaded the Phillipines in force. The good news is the Japanese aren&apos;t particularly well-versed in modern infantry tactics, nor is their equipment all that great. The bad news is their fanaticism and fighting spirit are unmatched, and we won&apos;t have good equipment either until we can be reinforced from the States. Your job is to organize the defense of the Bataan Peninsula near Manila until reinforcements arriveâ€¦ in other words, for as long as possible.</Text>
