	<Text>General MacArthur&apos;s intelligence staff is reporting that the advance thrust of the Japanese 22nd Army will fall upon your left flank fairly soon. We have to hold firm there, or the Japanese will be able to push down the coast road and roll back our entire position. As we have nowhere to roll back to at the moment, I strongly suggest that you hold them off.</Text>
