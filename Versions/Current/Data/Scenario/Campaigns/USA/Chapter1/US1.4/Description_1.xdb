	<Text>We won&apos;t last long with that artillery raining down on us. Take a detachment and neutralize the enemy gun batteries on Hill 261 to the north. We won&apos;t be able to hold off the entire Japanese army, but at least we can make &apos;em eat those howitzers. If you can do that much, we can retreat in good order to a tighter line further south.</Text>
