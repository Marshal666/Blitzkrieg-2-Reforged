	<Text>The Japanese have broken through our outer defenses near the village of Pundak! You must marshal your forces and react before the Japanese can push forward. Luckily for us so far, the Japanese haven&apos;t been quick to exploit this breach, but they&apos;re moving forces to Punak as fast as they can. You have to push them back before their reinforcements get there. The Japanese are relying upon artillery to protect their salient, so if we can deny them that, the better off we&apos;ll be.</Text>
