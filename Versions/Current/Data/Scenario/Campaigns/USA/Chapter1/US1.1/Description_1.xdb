	<Text>It looks like one of the main enemy landing areas will be in your sector. We&apos;re still attempting to re-establish contact with the outlying garrisons, so until we can marshal a relief force, your unit is all there is for now. Give &apos;em hell, and try and hold &apos;em off. Remember that your HQ has to remain standing so that we can tell if there&apos;s anyone left up there to reinforce or evacuate. Other coast-defense units reported wave after wave of assault troops until we lost contact.</Text>
