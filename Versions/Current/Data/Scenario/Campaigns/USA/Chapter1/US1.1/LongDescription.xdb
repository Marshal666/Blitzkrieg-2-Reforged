	<Text>War Plan Orange is now in effect. Both Clark Field and the city of Manila have been air-raided. The Japanese Fleet is now in control of the seas around the Phillipine Islands, and it may be a while before the Navy can regain control. We&apos;ve been getting a bunch of reports of Japanese infantry landing all along the coast of Luzon. While we&apos;re getting a handle on the situation, you will hold against any attacking force, keeping your base of operations intact.</Text>
