	<Text>The situation in Luzon is dire. There was never any hope of guarding the entirety of the island against a determined Japanese invasion, but neither did we expect a well-organized invasion of this magnitude, either. As we coordinate our defensive lines further south, you are to help the tank crew that has fallen behind and became trapped behind enemy lines. Do not let it fall into the enemy hands. Destroying this piece of valuable equipment is also out of the question. Bring it back and in one piece.</Text>
