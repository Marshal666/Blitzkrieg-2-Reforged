	<Text>First Marine Amphibious Corps has ordered us to seize and hold the Japanese headquarters bunker on the northwest corner of the island. Don&apos;t let yourselves get caught off-guard by any &apos;banzai charges&apos;. Move your men into position, cover the target zone with some bombardment, and scour the Japs out of their bunker. Use any means necessary. </Text>
