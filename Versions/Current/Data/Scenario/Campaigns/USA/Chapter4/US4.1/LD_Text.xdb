	<Text>Our objective here is fairly straightforward. The small islet in our path is far less valuable an objective than the larger island to the north where the main landing will take place. However, the Japanese have been loading lots of artillery onto this miserable little outcropping, enough to force us to land a detachment to clear the islet and open the landing zone on the other island. Eliminate all Japanese presence on the island, so that there will be no further danger.</Text>
