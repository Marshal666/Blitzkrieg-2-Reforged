	<Text>The Navy reports a last-ditch attempt by the Japanese to land a relief party on the island is in progress. Why the Navy didn&apos;t seal off the sea access to the island is beside the point. You&apos;ll have to engage that landing party as it comes ashore. Deny them any opportunity to entrench or fortify, or your mission will get a whole lot harder. </Text>
