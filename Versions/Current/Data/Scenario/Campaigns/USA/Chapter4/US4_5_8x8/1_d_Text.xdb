	<Text>Listen up - I know the objective is to clear the Japs out of that strongpoint up ahead, but the first thing is obviously to defend our starting position. Do not let the enemy push us out of the pillboxes at Checkpoint Romeo. The enemy commander is content to send infantry to attack machine-gun positionsâ€¦ don&apos;t validate their bad tactics by allowing them to succeed.</Text>
