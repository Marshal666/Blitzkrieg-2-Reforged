	<Text>The well established Allied forces along the river banks here can only be routed if we create forward defensive strongholds from which further expansion is possible.  Therefore, headquarters has asked that a series of key buildings be captured and local command has recommended that you be given the assignment. In this area of heavy enemy concentration, maneuvers are best made around enemy positions rather than attacking head on. Youâ€™ll encounter everything from tanks to infantry and artillery, and should expect counterattacks to threaten any positions you capture.  </Text>
