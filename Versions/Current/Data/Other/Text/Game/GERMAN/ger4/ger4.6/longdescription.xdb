	<Text>American forces in the ravine below our position are preparing to attack.  Regional command has asked that you be given the assignment of directing the defensive action here.  You do have the benefit of sufficient artillery power and call for some air support, but you will need to be careful about selecting your targets and use your heaviest artillery to take out the enemy tank destroyers that have armor that can resist the shells of our main anti tank guns.  We wish you good hunting! </Text>
