	<Text>Poke a hole in the defenses and get inside the Western Fort to capture this stronghold.  The Italians will be pressing from the south, but it will be up to you to insure that either this position is taken as quickly as possible.  Capturing the Eastern Fort will give another reinforcement position. </Text>
