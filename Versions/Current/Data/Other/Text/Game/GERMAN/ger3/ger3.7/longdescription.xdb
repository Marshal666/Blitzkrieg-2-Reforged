	<Text>As our forces approach the center of Stalingrad the fighting is heavy on every city block.  Russian counterattacks now target all our positions, but we must continue to press forward and occupy new neighborhoods block by block, all the while resisting those attacks on our initial positions.  Your assignment is to hold steady at your original location and direct exploratory armored teams that can capture key buildings and as we advance forward.  Maintaining control of key buildings and neighborhoods will stifle enemy reinforcement.</Text>
