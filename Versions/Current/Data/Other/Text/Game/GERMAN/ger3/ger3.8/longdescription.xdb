	<Text>Greater than expected Russian tenacity has resulted in two villages that we previously occupied being recaptured.  Your assignment is to gather a force that can recapture and then hold these two locations against any further attacks.  In addition to direct supply and reinforcements, headquarters suggests that you accumulate many of the unconnected German infantry troops that are wandering without direction here after the recent battles.  You have the authority to command any German forces you may encounter.</Text>
