	<Text>A large group of our tanks has recently arrived at the railway station and they have become bottled up here in town.  Enemy aircraft is starting to target this immobile armor, and we are particularly vulnerable here.  We ask that you take control of both the ground and air support that will be needed to forestall incoming enemy aircraft before they have a chance to damage the tanks.  You can expect incoming bombers, fighters, and ground attack strikes from several directions.</Text>
