	<Text>Two key Russian factories lie along the Volga River here.  German Command is anxious that you establish control of the factories and destroy the Red Army regional headquarters in position between the two facilities.  You may expect frequent counterattacks to either of the factories that you control, and the larger factory may continue to produce additional tanks that can be used against your forces until this production is halted.  Once the factories are under control, you may lead the attack against the military headquarters.</Text>
