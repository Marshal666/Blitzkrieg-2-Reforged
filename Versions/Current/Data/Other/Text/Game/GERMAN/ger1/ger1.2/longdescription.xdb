	<Text>This village ahead of you is one of the series of enemy strongholds that we need you to clear.  The two roads on your left and right are full of Allied reinforcements arriving to help in defending the town, so you may capture the strategic buildings along those roads to shut off those new arrivals before mounting a final push against the enemy headquarters and town proper. </Text>
