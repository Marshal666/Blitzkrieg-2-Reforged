	<Text>The Allies have two small towns occupied here, and the roads are too well protected for our ground forces to attack, so we will need to force them out, using our air power.  We ask that you direct the aerial attack, and we are confident that should you be able to inflict significant losses, the enemy troops will give way and abandon their positions.  </Text>
