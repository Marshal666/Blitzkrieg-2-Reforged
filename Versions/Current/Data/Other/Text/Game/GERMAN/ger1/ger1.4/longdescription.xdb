	<Text>We are given to understand that the French offer such pitiful resistance here that you and a fellow officer on the other side of the hill have taken it upon yourselves to wager regarding who among the two of you can be the first to capture the small train station that lies ahead.  Normally we would frown on such antics, but in this particular situation we do understand the value of such competitions, and therefore wish you both the best of luck.  May the best commander win!</Text>
