	<Text>During the tempestuous autumn of 1941, the German Afrika Korps and the British Eighth Army waged a bitter struggle for control of Libya. Much of the fighting was marked by fluid and often disorganized interactions between mobile groups of opposing units, in stark contrast to the static trench warfare of the previous war. Your careful command of British forces in the deserts of Cyrenaica could help bring victory to the beleaguered British, still searching for their first major victory more than a year after Dunkirk. Bring hope to the men of Albion by becoming the liberator of Tobruk! </Text>
