	<Text>By the fall of 1944, the Western Allies had succeeded in pushing the Germans out of most of France and Belgium, but the battle-hardened men of the Third Reich&apos;&apos;s armed forces were not yet defeated. Being motivated to prevent a repeat of the humiliation that was inflicted on them at Versailles, the Germans began reinforcing the Westwall as a land barrier to hinder the Anglo-American advance. All Allied forces in the West were heavily engaged in places like Saint Lo, Falaise, and Metz, or involved in pursuing the Germans eastward. After Normandy, however, the Allied paratroopers were waiting for action. </Text>
