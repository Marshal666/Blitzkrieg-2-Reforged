	<Text>Your mission here is to push the Afrika Korps back from El Alamein. You will find the Italian forces on Jerry&apos;&apos;s right flank to be of poorer quality than Rommel&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;s own troops, indicating an initial breakthrough in that sector might be easier than attempting to confront the field marshal&apos;&apos;s panzers head-on.  Actual enemy strength is unknown, but the Afrika Korps&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; supply system has obviously been strained to its limits, so it would be expedient to deny them the use of their own supply depot.</Text>
