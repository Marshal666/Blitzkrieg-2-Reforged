	<Text>Your force has been redirected to the aid the defence of checkpoint &apos;&apos;Oberon&apos;&apos;, where Commonwealth forces are now holding a captured German supply centre. You are to proceed immediately to defend this facility at all costs; the Jerries are expected to make a determined counter-attack at any time. Continued possession of &apos;&apos;Oberon&apos;&apos; will limit enemy capability in this campaign, but losing control of this area would give Rommel a chance at regrouping, and launching a devastating sally into our rear areas. That, we cannot allow. </Text>
