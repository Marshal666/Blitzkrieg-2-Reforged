	<Text>We do seem to be having our difficulties with this campaignâ€¦ radio intercepts from 1st Airborne indicate their headquarters element is out of contact, and we&apos;&apos;re dropping in some parachute battalions into Arnhem to lay claim to the western portion of the city. You&apos;&apos;re the closest commander we trust to get the job done, so you&apos;&apos;re going to rally these airborne men as soon as they&apos;&apos;re done dropping, and pull them together to take the town. Start with the armaments factory, and proceed from there.</Text>
