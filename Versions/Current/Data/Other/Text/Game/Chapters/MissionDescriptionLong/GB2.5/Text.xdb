	<Text>Because of your excellent performance in high-risk exploits up to now, 8th Army General Staff has decided to place you in charge of guarding the approaches to Mersa Matruh now that we have successfully pushed the Germans back from El Alamein. There will be a German reinforcement convoy arriving from Greece arriving shortly, and it will be up to you to destroy this force before it can make port.  Constant air reconnaissance will be key to discovering the enemy convoy and its escort ships. </Text>
