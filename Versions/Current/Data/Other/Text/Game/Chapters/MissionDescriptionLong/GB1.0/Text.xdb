	<Text>General Auchinleck has given us the formidable task of breaking the Axis siege of the city of Tobruk. Because Tobruk is a good seaport in the midst of these miserable barren wastes, we must retain control of this city in order to properly supply Eighth Army&apos;&apos;s operations in Libya. The Germans and Italians besieging Tobruk have placed a daunting number of defensive works in our path. As you deal with the enemy army, you must also be prepared to deal with minefields, artillery, and airpower. </Text>
