	<Text>You are tasked with leading a convoy from Forty-Third Infantry Division through what we assume is friendly territory, but recent signs and information from the Provost-General indicate that there may be Italian fascist partisans operating in the area, perhaps in conjunction with remnants of isolated German units which we might have failed to mop up. Whatever the potential risks, you are to organise security for the column, and see that something of an effective combat force arrives at the destination. The convoy must get through.</Text>
