	<Text>We have reserved another tough assignment for you, Commander. Because of your experience with dealing with fortifications, we shall require your expertise in taking a bridge away from the Germans along the Tiber River. It seems as if all of Eighth Army is waiting to cross this river, and I am tired of watching lesser commanders feed our good soldiers into the murderous fire of the German MG-42&apos;&apos;s. I must therefore prevail upon you to succeed where others have failed, and capture that miserable bridge.</Text>
