	<Text>As we maintain our advance, 7th Armoured&apos;&apos;s reconnaissance teams have spotted a German vanguard unit in a cantonment within a small desert village to the east. This is apparently an attempt to build a springboard from which the Germans could harass Eighth Army&apos;&apos;s supply lines, or perhaps launch a counter-offensive into Egypt. Whatever its purpose, it is now yours for summary liquidation. The Jerries must not seize the initiative; or else our armoured units may get severely bogged down here on the way to Tripoli.</Text>
