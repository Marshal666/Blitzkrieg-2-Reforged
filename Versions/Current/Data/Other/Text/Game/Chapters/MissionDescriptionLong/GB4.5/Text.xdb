	<Text>We&apos;&apos;re fighting to maintain the initiative in Market-Garden. Elements of Thirtieth Corps have from the main advance after spending valuable time pursuing several German units away from the main line of advance, allowing other German units to insinuate themselves in between, so we are sending you up there with the task of making sure they break back into friendly lines without egregious casualties. There&apos;&apos;s more than one route you might consider in order to reach the exit back to friendly lines.</Text>
