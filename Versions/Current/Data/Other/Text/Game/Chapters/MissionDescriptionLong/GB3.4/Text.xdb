	<Text>Greetings, commander. We are to prepare the battlefield for a surge forward by our armoured forces, and eliminate the enemy anti-tank and artillery strongpoints prior to the commencement of the armoured maneuver. Once this is complete, the armoured boys will owe us champagne and crumpets. Let&apos;&apos;s practice our artillery accuracy. We have noticed several abandoned German anti-tank guns within our reach; I would strongly recommend turning these around against their former owners. With luck, we can clean the enemy off those roads in two hours.</Text>
