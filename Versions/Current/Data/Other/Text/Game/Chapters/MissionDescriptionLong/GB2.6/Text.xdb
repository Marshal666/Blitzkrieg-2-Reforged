	<Text>After heavy fighting, the Desert Rats have surrounded and isolated a portion of the Afrika Korps, as well as its command headquarters. The likelihood of Rommel himself actually being present is rather low, but we are giving you the task of leading an airborne assault inside the German pocket to capture the enemy headquarters and thereby prevent the coordination of new enemy operations. These Germans are die-hards and will not submit gladly to our attempt to destroy their main base of operations. As always, Godspeed. </Text>
