	<Text>I&apos;&apos;m afraid we shall require your assistance for an emergent situation. German mechanized forces have managed to skirt around 8th Army&apos;&apos;s outer defences and are now approaching our supply outpost 10km northeast of Sinjabi Jabal. It seems a Bedouin tribesman in the area has sold the Germans an accurate map of the route through the treacherous quicksands to the south. You&apos;&apos;ll be required to form a defensive battlegroup out of engineers, artillerymen, and whoever else we could scrape together, and protect the outpost from capture.</Text>
