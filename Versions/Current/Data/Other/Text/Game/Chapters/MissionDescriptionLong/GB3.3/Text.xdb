	<Text>The HMS Erebus is suffering an artillery beating from Axis shore batteries covering both our land and sea lines of communication. Since the Navy seems to be incapable of eradicating the enemy artillery, it has fallen to the Army to provide the solution. Deal with defending enemy infantry and armour, and eliminate the German gun batteries. There is no way of knowing precisely what the Jerries have in this area, so do conserve your force as much as possible. I have no doubt you&apos;&apos;ll prevail. </Text>
