	<Text>The tide of battle have caused some of our forces holding the vital port city of Tobruk to become isolated from the rest of Eighth Army. Our units within Tobruk are strong and well-armed but must be prepared for a siege of indeterminate length before help can arrive. You might buy us the time we need by organizing the defenders most appropriately to face what is to come. Eighth Army will have its hands full contending with the main bulk of the Afrika Korps elsewhere. </Text>
