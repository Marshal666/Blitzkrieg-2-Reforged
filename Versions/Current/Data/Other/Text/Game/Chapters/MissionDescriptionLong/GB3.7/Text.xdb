	<Text>We have pocketed enemy units in a village up ahead. We don&apos;&apos;t have sufficient strength to mount an assault, but as we gather the forces necessary, your mission will be to lay siege to the town, seal it off from the outside, and prevent enemy relief forces from breaking through. This last notion may be the most difficult; three of the roads out of town lead to enemy territory, and German formations may attempt to break in at any time. Hold your ground.</Text>
