	<Text>You&apos;&apos;ve been tasked to conduct a &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;reconnaissance in force&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; into a well-defended sector of the Germans&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; Westwall fortification line. Montgomery&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;s staff wants an honest assessment of just how difficult the Westwall would be to open up, and this &apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;assessment&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos; is to be conducted with live personnel and valuable equipment. Take down the enemy defences, but expect resistance to be heavy - after all, the Germans are defending their own home soil for once. If you can accomplish this job, we&apos;&apos;&apos;&apos;ll be studying your report carefully.</Text>
