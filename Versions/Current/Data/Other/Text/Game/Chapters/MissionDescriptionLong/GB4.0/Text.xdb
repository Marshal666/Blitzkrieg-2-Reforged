	<Text>Another moment of decision has come in the war against Nazi Germany. General Eisenhower has ordered Operation Market-Garden to commence. Monty&apos;&apos;s plan for this endeavour involves dropping our airborne units upon key bridges along a line of advance northeastward into Holland. This is the &apos;&apos;Market&apos;&apos; phase of the operation, which will be supported by the &apos;&apos;Garden&apos;&apos; advance by Thirtieth Corps, which will connect the bridges, and establish a clear land route not just into Holland, but into the heart of the German Reich as well. </Text>
