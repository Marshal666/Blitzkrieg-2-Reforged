	<Text>There are more mechanised forces in Holland than we were led to expect. With the bulk of Thirtieth Corps plodding forward at a snail&apos;&apos;s pace, those panzers will be able to mow down the infantry left holding these bridges open for friendly tanks which may never arriveâ€¦ but enough of that. I&apos;&apos;m sending you forward with a small force, one which we hope will be sufficient to stop the German tank column from reaching its intended destination. There can be no substitute for victory.</Text>
