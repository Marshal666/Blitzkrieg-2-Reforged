	<Text>It seems the great offensive into Germany is finally getting underway via Holland. The American 101st Airborne is landing inside Holland and tasked with taking a bridge near the city of Nijmegen. You&apos;&apos;ll be leading the first armoured spearhead into the city to assist the Yanks in creating a pathway for our follow-on forces. That will help us in our drive to the ultimate objective, the Dutch city of Arnhem. Coordinate with the Americans to take the bridge and defend against possible German counter-attack.</Text>
