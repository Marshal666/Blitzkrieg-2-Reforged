	<Text>The valuable Caucasus oil fields are vital to our efforts for more than just this Russian campaign.  Capturing Stalingrad will not only ensure our army&apos;s petroleum supply here and from the south, but will also serve as a dramatic demoralizing blow to the Soviet citizenry.  However, determined Red Army forces are staging a desperate last stand, and are showing a surprising toughness. To ensure that our southeastern positions in Russia are well established before the harsh winter, firm and swift action must be taken to see that any further resistance in Stalingrad and the surrounding territory is crushed.</Text>
