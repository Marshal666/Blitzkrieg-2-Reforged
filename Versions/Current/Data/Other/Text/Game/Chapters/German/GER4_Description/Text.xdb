	<Text>As we here in the Ardennes remain strong and true through the cold wet winter, a glorious springtime for all of Germany will arrive at the end of our labors.   Although we have suffered reverses in some critical sectors, Germany&apos;s overall condition and military capacity is still superior to that of our opponents.  Winning the war now will be a matter of our pressing forward at a slower, but inexorable pace.  Where there is a hole, we will enlarge it, where there is a wall, we will climb over it.  We will come pouring through the enemy defenses like a torrent of angry water.</Text>
