	<Text>During WWI the Marne River in northeastern France witnessed the bitter failure of the last major German offensive.  Determined not to suffer a similar loss this time, German troops are now advancing successfully during the Blitzkrieg, and will have the pleasure of sweeping across the Marne as they rout the last Allied resistance there.  This easy victory will hardly be the turning point in the war as it was some twenty five years ago, but this time the winner will be Germany, proving that any defensive plans of the Allies can be shattered by an aggressive, innovative, and well-coordinated German Army!</Text>
