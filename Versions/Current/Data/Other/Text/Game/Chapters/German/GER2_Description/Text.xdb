	<Text>Because of the critical British shipping and oil supply value of the Suez canal, Germany is quite anxious to assert its own control over Egypt and the North African region.  Re-establishing control in the Italian colony of Libya is necessary in attaining this goal, and capturing the Allied garrisons in and around Tobruk near the Eqyptian border will be an important key to eventual success in the North African campaign.  General Erwin Rommel is commanding two German regiments and the 21st Italian Corps here, and the once strong Allied garrison of British, Polish, and Australians soldiers is already strained severely and ready to capitulate.   </Text>
