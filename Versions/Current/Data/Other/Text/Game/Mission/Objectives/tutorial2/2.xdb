	<Text>Unit armor and weapon penetration.
Tank armor is weakest at the sides and back. Attack neutral tank (use the &lt;color=FFCFCF00&gt;&apos;E&apos;&lt;color=FFCFCFCF&gt; key). Note that your units are trying to move themselves for the better shooting position to attack unit&apos;s side or back.</Text>
