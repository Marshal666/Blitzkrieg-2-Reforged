	<Text>This attack caught us by surprise, with most forces too distant to provide much help. You will have to position your anti-tank guns very carefully, as there is little else in your inventory which will stop armoured vehicles from reaching the outpost. The Germans are still trying to stop our advance by interfering with our ability to keep our forces supplied. </Text>
