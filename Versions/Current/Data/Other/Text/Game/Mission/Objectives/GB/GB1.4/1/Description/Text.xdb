	<Text>Time is short, so I shall be brief. The Afrika Korps has moved on past Tobruk, intent upon savaging the bulk of the retiring Eighth Army, after leaving a covering force of Italians to manage the siege of the city. These Italians are being prodded by Rommel into attacking against the Tobruk defences, giving you a short period of time to reposition forces. Be carefull, italians can attack your forces by bombers. Use your fighters for repelling its strike.</Text>
