	<Text>It seems the Germans have managed to move elements of the 15th Army back across the Scheldt Estuaryâ€¦ some are now moving in from the west to retake the bridge. You&apos;&apos;ll need to re-position your forces to improvise a defence against an attack from that direction. We cannot allow the Germans to recapture that bridge. That would disrupt the entire advance.</Text>
