	<Text>We are searching for elements of 4th Armoured Brigade&apos;&apos;s reconnaissance company, possibly two platoons worth. I suspect you will not miss being away from the battle front for as long as it will take to track down these scouts. First drive north across the desert and attempt to locate Lieutenant Sutherland&apos;&apos;s jeep. He should join your team and render aid to you.
