	<Text>With two unanticipated panzer units in the area, we&apos;&apos;ll need to seize the town just south of the Rhine River to prevent a panzer group from setting up in there - if they do, they will put our entire advance under a punishing barrage which will cause the whole operation to fail. I know this is a lot of objectives to juggle, but the situation demands we take that town. </Text>
