	<Text>Now we have but one more item on our agenda. Move up to the northeast and take the outskirts of Arnhem, so that we have a decent foothold for when the liberation of the city is undertaken. We certainly mustn&apos;&apos;t allow the Germans to entrench themselves there first. If we can capture Arnhem, we may very well shorten the entire war, and have us home by Christmas.</Text>
