	<Text>Good show. Corps Intelligence has noted that the German supply depot in your sector is the key to organizing and re-equipping enemy combat formations in your area. By capturing this facility, it is supposed that the appearance of German reinforcements in this area will be greatly diminished. Move forward with as much haste as necessary and take this depot. </Text>
