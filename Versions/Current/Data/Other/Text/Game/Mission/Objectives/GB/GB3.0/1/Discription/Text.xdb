	<Original>Seize the railway station.</Original>
	<Text>The approaches to the bridge to the west are too thick with Germans to bother attacking, but we might be able to take the railway station to the south away from them without as much fuss. Then we might be able to get into Monte Cassino by a more circuitous route, perhaps over one of the bridges to the west. It is not advisable to split your forces at this juncture.
