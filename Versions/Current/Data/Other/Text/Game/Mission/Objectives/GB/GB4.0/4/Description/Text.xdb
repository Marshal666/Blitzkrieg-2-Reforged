	<Text>Nowâ€¦ I think it advisable that we deal with that troublesome artillery to the southwest, the one that&apos;&apos;s just opened up on us. We can&apos;&apos;t move our forces into Arnhem in the face of German heavy artillery. Take what forces you think necessary and clear out their artillery, and anything else the German still possess south of the Rhine which can harm our lines.</Text>
