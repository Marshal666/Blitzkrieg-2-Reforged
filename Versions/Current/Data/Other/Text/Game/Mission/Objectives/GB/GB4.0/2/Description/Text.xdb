	<Text>Even worseâ€¦ nothing has been done to clear either of the two bridges immediately in front of us. The airborne units tasked to seize these bridges have either been overrun or have formed up with other units. We&apos;&apos;ll have to do the bloody job ourselves, and there is no time to lose.
