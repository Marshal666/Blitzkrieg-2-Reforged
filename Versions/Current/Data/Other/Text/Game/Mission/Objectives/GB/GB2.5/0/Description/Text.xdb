	<Original>The Enemy sends their own sea transports on west.
You should destroy all transports before that what the card cross.</Original>
	<Text>Destroy as many of the German transport ships as you can. Each one of the freighters is attempting to bring troops, equipment, and supplies to the Afrika Korps, and therefore must be stopped. Air and sea reconnaissance will be necessary to detect the enemy convoy, in turn allowing artillery to come to bear on convoy targets. Beware of the German escort boats. </Text>
