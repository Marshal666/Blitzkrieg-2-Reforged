	<Text>Intelligence on this area is sketchy, but there may be a regiment of German infantry scattered among the small villages in this areaâ€¦ there are three routes you might take to the exit zone - the east route may put you in touch with friendly artillery units to cover your maneuvering. The middle route looks safe to me, but the final decision, of course, is yours. </Text>
