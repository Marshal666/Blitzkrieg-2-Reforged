	<Text>It would be wise to defeat the weaker Italian forces to the west before taking on the German forces in the north.  We&apos;&apos;ll first need to punch a hole in the enemy&apos;&apos;s outer defenses, in order to best dispatch the Italian defenders. There is no prize for second place, old chap, so do try to achieve your aims.  Mr. Churchill is not prepared to hear more news of failure from Eighth Army.  </Text>
