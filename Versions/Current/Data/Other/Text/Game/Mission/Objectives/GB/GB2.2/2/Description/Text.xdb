	<Text>The Germans are sending in more panzers. Rommel thinks he can corner and destroy a major part of 8th Army&apos;&apos;s armoured strength here. You can disrupt Rommel&apos;&apos;s plan by taking Balad Aziza and denying its use as a German staging area. Resistance is estimated to be heavy. There is nothing that can be done to salvage the situation if you should fail in your assignment. </Text>
