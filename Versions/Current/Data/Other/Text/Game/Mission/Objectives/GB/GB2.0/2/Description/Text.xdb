	<Text>Intelligence has located Rommel&apos;&apos;s forward supply base. Capturing this facility should allow us to dedicate additional reinforcements to your command, in addition to denying these important supplies to the Jerries. Once you have captured the Axis supply dump and disposed of all enemy resistance thereabouts, you will have the initiative to press on.
