	<Text>Bloody hell. Not only has Polish Brigade&apos;&apos;s landing been bollixed up by the arrival of an elite German panzer unit, but 1st Airborne Division is also having trouble on the north bank of the Rhineâ€¦ a second damned panzer unit is in the area! 2nd Army intelligence is at a loss to explain this development. We must reinforce the paratroopers or the mission will fail. </Text>
