	<Text>It might be best to wait until all the German tanks are in sight before launching the ambush, as the tanks may be escorted by infantry. It is possible that the Germans may try and flee from the road and reach the exit point by an alternate route, so do try and develop a good plan for that contingency. Not one of these panzers must be permitted to escape!</Text>
