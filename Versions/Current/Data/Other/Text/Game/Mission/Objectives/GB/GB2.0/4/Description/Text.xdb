	<Text>Things have progressed well thus far, but we mustn&apos;&apos;t let up on the Germans. You are authorized to cut off and eliminate the German military headquarters, stopping Rommel&apos;&apos;s ability to give orders to his forces. If you can successfully subdue all enemy resistance in and around the German headquarters bunker, the victory shall be ours. Good luck and Godspeed</Text>
