	<Original>Seize the airfield.</Original>
	<Text>Taking the airfield requires you to eliminate both the armoured car patrols taking place along the airfield perimeter and the infamous &apos;&apos;88&apos;&apos; flak gun emplacements at each corner of the tarmac. Our tactical intelligence also places German infantry within the airfield&apos;&apos;s barracks buildings, and stationed near the entrance to the nearby oasis. Don&apos;t  let anyone escape the field or the superior force will be called in by the Germans.</Text>
