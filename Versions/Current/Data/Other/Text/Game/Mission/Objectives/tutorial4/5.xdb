	<Text>When attacked, infantry in aggressive formation does not lie down. This is very useful when rushing buildings and tanks.

To put infantry in an aggressive state, press the &lt;color=FFCFCF00&gt;&apos;S&apos;&lt;color=FFCFCFCF&gt; key and then the &lt;color=FFCFCF00&gt;&apos;A&apos;&lt;color=FFCFCFCF&gt; key. Move to the designated point in aggressive formation.</Text>
