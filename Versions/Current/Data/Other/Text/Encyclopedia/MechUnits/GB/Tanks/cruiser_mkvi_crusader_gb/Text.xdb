	<Text>Until the end of WW2 the British continued to develop infantry and cruiser tanks separately. Thick armor was the first and most important requirement for infantry tanks, while cruiser tanks were designed for independent action on the battlefield and accordingly had high speed and long range, but light armor.

The work on the last pre-war cruiser tank, the Crusader, began in 1936 according to a proposal introduced by British Military Mission members who observed Soviet BT tanks during Red Army maneuvers.  The BT was based on a design by the American inventor, Walter Christie.  The British also purchased the design and in November of the same year a 1932 model was smuggled out of the USA and into England, despite the ban imposed by the American government.  The following year the Nuffield Organization started work on the MkIII (A.13 MkI) cruiser tank, with 14mm thick armor.  On the newer models the armor was gradually strengthened, until the company offered a heavy cruiser tank with the Liberty engine called the &quot;Cruiser MkIV&quot; (A.15 Crusader MkI).

Some sources insist that the Crusader&apos;s hull and turret armor was 50mm thick, but this isn’t entirely true.  The British designers, given the task to ensure that the tank had 50mm of armor came up with a clever solution instead.  They installed thinner armor with steeper surface angles, and then recalculated the strength for vertical armor plates.  Only the frontal turret plate of the Crusader was actually 50mm thick.  Crusaders are best known for their success in North Africa during the operation to lift the blockade of Tobruk, which was named for the tank.  Their speed and range proved to be especially valuable there.  The Crusader was more mobile than any of the German tanks at the time, but in combat the tanks weapons and armor was found wanting.  It’s cannon had good armor-piercing potential, but a lack of high-explosive ammunition left it prey to anti-tank artillery.  The clever re-calculations of armor strength didn&apos;t help it either as well as the fact that they were quite difficult to handle, and their reliability left a lot to be desired.  In 1942 the Crusader was replaced by the Cromwell tank, that was in effect, an advance on the Crusader design which also served as an antiaircraft platform.
