	<Text>Mortars are probably the best example of a powerful, yet inexpensive, infantry weapon.  The Soviet Union first began using them during the Russian-Japanese war in Port Arthur, but their roots go much deeper, all the way back to ancient mortars and catapults.  Mortars filled a need for the infantry that rifled cannons with their excessive costs and firepower could not - short range and quick delivery of explosive shells.  During WWI, various mortar designs were used, but by the beginning of WWII most mortars were made using a Stocks-Brandt ignition scheme offering one advantage over other systems - it was simple and therefore also cheap.  This advantage proved to be crucial and soon the design, consisting of a guiding tube, base plate and supports, was copied worldwide.  Most countries only used light mortars ranging up to 82mm.  

The Soviet Union, however, decided that such an inexpensive and powerful weapon should have a wide range of calibres, including large ones.  Eventually they adopted both 120mm and 160mm mortar designs.  The advantages were clear, the 120mm mortar weighed 9 times less than a 122mm howitzer, and 22 times less than a 122mm cannon.  In addition, it was more effective against personnel than either of the two because of a faster rate of fire, and the ability to hit targets behind cover.  These heavy mortars allowed the Red Army to concentrate dense fields of fire with very modest resources, not to mention that it was one of the only heavy weapons available to paratroopers and partisans.  The 120mm mortar was so successful, that it was adopted by the Germans without any modifications, and is one of the few weapons that remains practically unchanged to this day.
