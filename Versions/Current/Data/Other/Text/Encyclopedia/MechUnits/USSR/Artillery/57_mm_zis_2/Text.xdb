	<Text>By 1940 the Red Army realized that not one of their anti-tank cannons could pierce the armor of even their own advanced tanks such as the T-34 and KV-1.  This combined with the knowledge that the Germans were beginning to build tanks with even thicker armor led to the decision to deploy a more powerful 57mm cannon.  The design was completed in just a few months and testing showed that it was able to pierce 90mm of armor at a kilometers distance (0.6 miles).  By March 1941 the ZIS-2 was in service.

In the summer of 1941 when the German Army invaded the Soviet Union the Red Army quickly realized that most of the German tanks were not heavily armored and that their 45mm cannons could deal with them quite effectively.  It was at this point that production on the ZIS-2 stopped, but the tooling remained in place to restart production once it was needed.   

That time came once the Pz V Panther and Pz VI Tigers came into use by the German Army.  The ZIS-2 was rapidly put back into production and for a long period of time was the only cannon able to effectively counter the new German tanks.  

The ZIS-2 proved to be a remarkable anti-tank weapon as was demonstrated after the battle in the outskirts of Siauliai in Lithuania where for each ruined cannon there were three destroyed German tanks.  Even Britain was duly impressed by its performance as it requested a number of them for it&apos;s own use.  The ZIS-2 was widely regarded the most powerful cannon of it&apos;s caliber at the time.
