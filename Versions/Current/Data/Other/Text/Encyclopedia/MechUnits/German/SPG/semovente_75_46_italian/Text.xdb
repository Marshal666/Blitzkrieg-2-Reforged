	<Text>At the beginning of the war the Italian tank industry was lagging behind most other countries by ten to fifteen years.  The latest Italian 13/39 and 14/40 tanks were created on the basis of the Vickers 6 Ton, like the Russian T-26 and Polish 7 TP.  Their framework consisted of welded angled sections with bullet-resistant armor plates attached by rivets and bolts.  The Italians equipped it with weapons arranged in two rows and proudly called it a &quot;medium tank&quot; which began to be manufactured during the war.  

The success of the German StuG III self-propelled artillery unit prompted the Italians to design a similar weapon.  Using the 14/40 tank as a basis, they designed a whole family of self-propelled artillery units called Semovente.  The numbers after the name indicated the cannon&apos;s caliber and its length.  The Semoventes, although based on inferior tanks, were surprisingly effective.  The cannon mounted on a spacious cabin was easy to handle, and the Semovente&apos;s silhouette proved to lower than any other self-propelled artillery unit in its class, which also made it easy to camouflage on the battlefield.

The Semovente wasn&apos;t used in the Italian army for long, but after Italy&apos;s capitulation they were used widely by German troops.  Many German tank men valued it higher than their own StuG III, because it was less visible.  The Semovente 75/34 was credited for destroying many Allied tanks.
