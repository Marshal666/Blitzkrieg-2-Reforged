	<Text>WWII was especially significant in that it was the first large war where air power played a major role.  Each country had to find a way to protect not only stationary positions from air strikes, but moving troops also.  In the first years of the war Germany ruled the skies and didn&apos;t focus much attention on manufacturing self-propelled anti-air units as they had little to worry about.  Things began to change in 1942 though and Germany began to seriously pursue the production of a better self-propelled gun.  They tried various designs mixing different types of guns and chassis, but only in 1944 did they manage to produce a truly remarkable unit.  They mounted four anti-air cannon in an open rotating turret, which was mounted on a Pz.IV chassis.  The result was incredible - the Wirbelwind was always combat-ready and not only was it effective for covering mobilized troops on the go, but thanks to the all-purpose sights that had been installed, it was an awesome anti-personnel weapon.  In northern France, a single Wirbelwind managed to disperse and destroy an entire infantry battalion of 800 men.  Due its late introduction, very few of these truly exceptional weapons were manufactured by the end of the war.
