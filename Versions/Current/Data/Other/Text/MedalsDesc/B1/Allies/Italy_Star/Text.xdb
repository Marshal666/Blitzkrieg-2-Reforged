	<Text>Operational service in Sicily or Italy between 11 June 1943 (capture of the island of Pantellaria) and 8 May 1945 was the main criterion for this star. However, service elsewhere in the Mediterranean, the Aegean, Dodecanese, Corsica, Greece, Sardinia, Yugoslavia, Elba and indeed even the entry into Austrian territory in the later stages of the war could serve to qualify although for some of these areas time limits were set.  The ribbon colours represent the national colours of Italy.
