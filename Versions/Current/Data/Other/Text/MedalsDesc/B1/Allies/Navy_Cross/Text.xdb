	<Text>This decoration was originally awarded for combat and noncombat heroism. Although most of the early awards were issued for World War I service, others were presented for heroism in rescue opertions involving submarine disasters. The medal was designed by James E. Fraser and was authorized by Congress on February 4, 1919. It was made a combat-only award in 1942 and was also given precedence over the Distinguished Service Medal at this time, making it the Navy&apos;s second highest decoration.
