	<Text>The Navy Medal of Honor Created by an Act of Congress of December 21, 1861, and designed by Christian Schussel, this medal was awarded to Navy and Marine Corps personnel. Unlike the Army Medal of Honor, it was originally given for noncombat, as well as combat, heroism; many early awards were for lifesaving. After World War I, a new version of the medal was designed by Tiffany &amp; Co as a combat-only decoration. On February 4, 1919, this version was authorized by Congress, primarily for personnel who had distinguished themselves in combat during WWI. The older form of the medal was awarded for noncombat heroism until 1942.</Text>
