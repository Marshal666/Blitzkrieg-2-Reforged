	<Text>The Allied forces are pushing hard here and all of our positions are experiencing pressure.  Although there are no large groups of hostile forces on the ground, enemy bombers and paratroopers are arriving frequently during the night,  and from various directions.  These units are causing constant trouble for the defenders in the key positions we occupy, so your assignment will be to hold the most important buildings in the three townships here and protect them against these Allied air attacks.</Text>
