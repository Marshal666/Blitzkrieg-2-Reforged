	<Text>South of the river and the town center, we occupy a strategic position.  We ask you now to take command of the defenses of this location, and guard against any attacks from the forces that seem to be building up north of the river.  Enemy paratroopers are beginning to target the three bridges that cross the river here.  Keeping German control of the bridges is one certain key to maintaining a solid defensive perimeter and not allowing the Allied forces to attack with their tanks.</Text>
