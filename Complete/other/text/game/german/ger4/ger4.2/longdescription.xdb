	<Text>A group of German tank units are trapped in the pocket here, and your assignment is to lead them out. The most direct route to the safe zone would be fighting through the town but the western defenses are too strong there.  Instead, the tanks must work their way between the enemy fortifications along the twisting mountain roads and mount any strikes against the town from the east side of the river.  Allied air attacks are likely against any tanks that do not keep moving constantly.</Text>
