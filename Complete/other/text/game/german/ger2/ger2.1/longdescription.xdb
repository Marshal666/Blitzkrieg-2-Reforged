	<Text>Although we have hurt them badly, the Allied garrison still has ample stores, and in order to increase pressure we need to reduce their supplies. Your assignment here is to lead a group of commandoes in an attack on two key storage depots.  Your team will arrive by landing craft under cover of darkness, and once you take control of the beach position additional reinforcements will be sent in to assist with your penetration inland and placing of explosives in the enemy depots.</Text>
