	<Text>Our hard work in laying siege to Tobruk is finally being rewarded, and the Allied garrison is ready to fall.  We want you to lead the victorious liberation, but there are a few preliminary steps that must be accomplished before your final push.  Your mission will require attacking the fortifications around the Western fort, penetrating, and capturing the fort.  After removing the nearby entrenched British armor, you will be able to take control of the civilian areas of Tobruk, and then force the garrison to surrender.</Text>
