	<Text>To the north on this road the Allies have constructed a well fortified block point that serves to guard a key crossroads and the roadways leading into the adjoining valley.  The valley itself contains two strategic transportation positions including a small village that straddles the road to the west and an important mountain pass road that leads southwest. Your assignment is to first capture the crossroads block point and destroy all the enemy troops within, and then to assist by attacking one or the other of the valley positions. </Text>
