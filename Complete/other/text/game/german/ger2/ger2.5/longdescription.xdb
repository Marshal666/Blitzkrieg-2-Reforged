	<Text>All preparations are in place, and the attack against the enemy positions in this area will commence soon.  But in order for the attack to have a good chance of success, two critical actions must be taken beforehand.  First, the enemy long range artillery to the west must be eliminated, and second, the bridge leading north must be blown to forestall any reinforcements arriving.  Your assignment is to parachute in and lead the commando teams that accomplish these two critical tasks before our general attack begins. </Text>
