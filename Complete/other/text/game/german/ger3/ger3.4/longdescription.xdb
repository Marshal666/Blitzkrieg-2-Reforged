	<Text>Your mission is to defend this village from attacks by the Red Army.  You can expect strong pressure from the enemy force to the east and ground attack planes patrolling the surrounding area.   We are experiencing temporary supply problems and all village commanders in this area have been asked to urgently consider salvaging the damaged equipment that is within their reach.  Repair and refit centers should be established to process both collected materiel and organize the small groups of soldiers who have become separated from their units. </Text>
