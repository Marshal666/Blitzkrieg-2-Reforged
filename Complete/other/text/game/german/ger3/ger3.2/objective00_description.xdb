	<Text>Guide and protect the convoy of trucks as they make their way to the destination point in the southwest.  Expect constant harassment from enemy snipers and small mobile groups.  Only a few suitable roads and bridges exist, so send scouts ahead and do not allow enemy attacks to disrupt the roadway. </Text>
