	<Text>We’ve got a critical job for a group of tanks here, and we’ve selected you to take charge of the operation.  In order to take possession of a key village along the main roadway we need an armored team to bypass a series of minefields along the route. You’ll need to take out the engineers that are setting the mines at each section, and once you  reach the village you should be able to swing wide and approach the Allied positions from the rear. </Text>
