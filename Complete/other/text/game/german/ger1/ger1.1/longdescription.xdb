	<Text>The Allies have two small towns occupied here, and the roads are too well protected for our ground forces to attack, so we will need got to force get them out using our air power.  We ask that you direct the aerial attack, and we are confidant that should you be able to inflict significant losses, the enemy troops will give way and abandon their positions.  Youâ€™ll need to be both fast and careful though, because new reinforcements, including mobile anti-aircraft guns, are arriving steadily.</Text>
