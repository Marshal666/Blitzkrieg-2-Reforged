	<Text>This village ahead of you is the latest in the series of enemy strongholds that we need you to clear.  The two roads on your left and right are full of Allied reinforcements arriving to help in defending the town, so you’ll need to capture the strategic buildings along those roads to shut off those new arrivals before mounting a final push against the enemy headquarters and town proper.  If you can surround the troops in the town center, we’re confidant you can acquire some valuable prisoners.</Text>
