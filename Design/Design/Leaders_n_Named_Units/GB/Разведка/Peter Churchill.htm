        the most famous of these who did was a French girl, Odette Brailly, who 
        had married an Englishman named Sansom by whom she had three children. 
        She was parachuted in to serve as courier to Peter Churchill, a 
        Cambridge ice-hockey blue, who had been operating over an extensive area 
        of southern France. Both were arrested. Odette Sansom succeeded in 
        convincing her interrogators that it was she and not Churchill who made 
        the decisions and, as the citation for the George Cross which she was 
        awarded stated, that it was she and not Churchill who should be shot. In 
        fact they both survived, not least because of the skill with which 
        Odette Sansom caused her interrogators to believe that Peter Churchill 
        was related to Winston Churchill and that she was Peter Churchill's 
        wife. They were indeed to be married later. </FONT></P>

        been captured because of the work they were doing or the people who they 
        were with. And I did too. Everybody tried to be a little braver than 
        they felt. All of us had a moment of weakness, we did all cry together 
        at one moment, there were a few tears, but after all it was a lovely 
        spring day in Paris. Riding in the van from the Avenue Foch to the 
        station we could get a glimpse of what was going on in Paris, people 
        sitting on the terraces of cafes drinking their ersatz coffee or 
        whatever.</FONT></P>

        miserable. No, we made the best of it. I remember one of them even asked 
        a guard for a cigarette, and he gave her one.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We were frightened deep 
        down, all of us. We were wondering what was the next thing, a normal 
        thing to ask yourself in those circumstances. Were we going straight to 
        our death, were we going to a camp, were we going to a prison, were we 
        going to - what? We couldn't not think of those things. Our only hope

        Odette Hallowes, <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRtimes.htm"><I>The 
        Times</I></A> (17th March, 1975)</FONT></B><BR></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Of all the women who took 
        part in special operations in France, Odette - as she was universally 
        known in spite of having borne three married surnames in her lifetime - 
        perhaps best symbolized the indomitable spirit of resistance to Nazism. 
        Captured by the Gestapo in France and consigned after being cruelly 
        tortured in Paris's notorious Fresnes prison, to Ravensbrück 
        concentration camp, she emerged emaciated, weak and gravely ill at the 
        end of the war. But in the years that followed, her undiminished mental 
        and moral energy, combined with a complete absence of bitterness towards 
        her tormentors and the nation that had spawned them, became a beacon to 
        others who had suffered disfigurement, pain or bereavement. Indeed the 
        theme of her postwar working life, with its service to various charities 
        and help for the underprivileged, was the healing of those wounds, both 
        physical and mental, which had been inflicted upon individuals by the 
        war. Her George Cross, she always maintained, was not to be regarded as 
        an award to her personally, but as an acknowledgment of all those known 
        and unknown, alive or dead, who had served the cause of the liberation 
        of France. Her wartime experiences had taught her two great truths; that 
        suffering is an ineluctable part of the human lot, and that the battle 
        against evil is never over. Fame came to her - notably, through the film 
        Odette which celebrated her life - but she never sought it. </FONT><FONT
