        Gort, the son of 5th Viscount Gort, was born in County Durham in 1886.

        Cross</A> at Canal du Nord. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>After the war 
        Gort taught at the Staff College and was promoted to the rank of colonel 
        in 1925. He also served as Commander of the Guards Brigade (1930-32), 
        Director of Military Training in India (1932-36) and Commander of the 
        Staff College (1936-39). </FONT></P>

        Gort's appointment to command the B.E.F. in September was a mistake; the 
        job was above his ceiling. Moreover, G.H.Q. of the B.E.F. had never 
        conducted any exercises, either with or without troops, from the time we 
        landed in France in 1939 up to the day active operations began in May 
        1940. The need for wireless silence was given as an excuse; but an 
        indoor exercise on the model could easily have been held. The result was 
        a total lack of any common policy or tactical doctrine throughout the 
        B.E.F.; when differences arose these difficulties remained, and there 
        was no firm grip from the top. </FONT></P>

        face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The man for whom I felt most sorry 
        was our commander-in-chief, Lord Gort. The French seemed to have gone to 
        pieces on his right, yet he was under their command, and the orders he 
        received didn't make sense. At the same time he was responsible to the 
        British Government for the safety of the British troops. And then, as a 
        final blow, the Belgian Army on his left was forced to 
        capitulate.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Gort was neither a great 
        strategist nor a deep military thinker. He couldn't stand up at a 
        conference and deliver a brilliant military appreciation. Even when 
        C.-in-C. he remained essentially a front- line regimental officer who 
        was always more interested in the details of battle than in the 
        strategical picture. Yet, where a more brilliant soldier might have lost 
        his nerve, Gort remained staunch to the end, and thus showed the one 
        essential quality required in times of adversity by all 
        commanders-mental toughness. I have always felt that he never received 
        the credit which was his due.</FONT></P>
