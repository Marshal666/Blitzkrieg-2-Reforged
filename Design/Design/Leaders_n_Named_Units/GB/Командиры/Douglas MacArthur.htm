        size=3>Douglas MacArthur, the son of the high-ranking military figure, 
        Arthur MacArthur,<B> </B>was born in Little Rock, Arkansas, on 26th 
        January, 1880. Although previously a poor scholar, in 1903 MacArthur 
        graduated first in his 93-man class, at <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAwestpoint.htm">West Point 
        Military Academy</A>. <BR><BR>Commissioned in the Corps of the

        Army</A> to the <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWphilippines.htm">Philippines</A> 
        and by 1904 had been promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. Later 
        that year he joined his father who was serving in Far East before 
        becoming aide-de-camp to President <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USArooseveltT.htm">Theodore 
        Roosevelt</A> in 1906.<BR></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
        size=3>MacArthur was assigned to general staff duty with the War 
        Department and was an official observer with the Vera Cruz Expedition. 
        On the advice of General <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWwood.htm">Leonard 
        Wood</A>, MacArthur was promoted to major.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=3>In the 
        <A href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWW.htm">First World 
        War</A> MacArthur commanded the 42nd Division on the <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWwestern.htm">Western 
        Front</A> and was decorated 13 times and cited seven additional times 
        for bravery. Promoted the the rank of brigadier in August, 1918, three 
        months later he became the youngest divisional commander in <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/France.htm">France</A>. 
        <BR><BR>After the war MacArthur returned to the <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USA.htm">United States</A> 
        where he became brigadier general and the youngest ever superintendent 
        of <A href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAwestpoint.htm">West 
        Point</A> in its 117 year history. Over the next three years he doubled 
        its size and modernized the curriculum.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=3>In 
        1922 MacArthur was sent to the <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWphilippines.htm">Philippines</A> 
        where he commanded the newly established Military District of Manila. At 
        the age of forty-three MacArthur became the army's youngest general and 
        in 1928 was appointed president of the American Olympic 
        Committee.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 
        size=3>MacArthur was appointed chief of staff of the <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWusa.htm">US Army</A> in 
        1930. Once again he was the youngest man to hold the office and over the 
        next few years attempted to modernize America's army of 135,000 men. 
        MacArthur developed right-wing political views and at one meeting argued 
        that: "Pacifism and its bedfellow, Communism, are all about us. Day by 
        day this cancer eats deeper into the body politic." </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=3>In 
        June 1932, MacArthur, controversially used tanks, four troops of cavalry 
        with drawn sabers, and infantry with fixed bayonets, on the <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAbonus.htm">Bonus Army</A> 
        in Washington. He justified his attack on former members of the <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWusa.htm">United States 
        Army</A> by claiming that the country was on the verge of a communist

        <A

        He retired from the army in 1937 but stayed on the island where he 
        became the country's military adviser.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=3>When 
        negotiations with the Japanese government broke down in June 1941, 
        Roosevelt recalled MacArthur to active duty as a major general and was 
        granted $10 million to mobilize the Philippine Army. It was also decided 
        to send MacArthur 100 <A

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000 size=3>Most 
        of MacArthur's troops were deployed to protect the two main islands of

        fighters, bombers and reconnaissance aircraft and this provided a 
        "tremendously strong offensive and defensive force" and claimed that the 
        Philippines was now the "key or base point of the US defence

        air strikes on the Philippines and destroyed half of MacArthur's air 
        force. MacArthur was much criticized for this as he had been told to 
        move his airforce after the raid on Hawaii the previous day.</FONT></P>

        bases in northern Luzon. On 22nd December the 14th Army landed at 
        Lingayen Gulf and quickly gained control of Manila from the 
        inexperienced Filipino troops. Although only 57,000 Japanese soldiers 
        were landed on Luzon it had little difficulty capturing the island.

        Commander-in-Chief of the US Navy, Macarthur and Nimitz, decided that 
        their first objective should be to establish and protect a line of 
        communications across the South Pacific to Australia. This resulted in

        landings on vulnerable islands, therefore bypassing Japanese troop 
        concentrations on fortified islands. This had the advantage of avoiding 
        frontal assaults and thus reducing the number of American casualties.

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>By the spring

        naval concentrations; he has forwarded (probably inspired) letter from 
        Mr. Quezon; statements (Quisling) from Aguinaldo; he complains about 
        lack of unity of command, about lack of information. He's

        factor. The Dutch want planes; the Australians want planes; ABDA has to

        February, 1942: Message to MacArthur was approved by president and 
        dispatched. I'm dubious about the thing. I cannot help believing that we 
        are disturbed by editorials and reacting to "public opinion" rather than 
        to military logic. Watson is certain we must get MacArthur out, as being 
        worth "five army corps. " He is doing a good job where he is, but I'm 
        doubtful that he'd do so well in more complicated situations. Bataan is 
        made to order for him. It's in the public eye; it has made him a public 
        hero; it has all the essentials of drama; and he is the acknowledged 
        king on the spot. If brought out, public opinion will force him into a 
        position where his love of the limelight may ruin him.</FONT></P>

        1942: MacArthur is out of Philippine Islands. Now supreme commander of 
        "Southwest Pacific Area." The newspapers acclaim the move - the public 
        has built itself a hero out of its own imagination. I hope he can do the 
        miracles expected and predicted; we could use a few now. Strange that no 
        one sees the dangers. Some apply to MacArthur, who could be ruined by 
        it. But this I minimize; I know him too well. The other danger is that 
        we will move too heavily in the Southwest. Urging us in that direction 
        now will be: Australians, New Zealanders, our public (wanting support 
        for the hero), and MacArthur. If we tie up our shipping for the SW 
        Pacific, we'll lose this war. </FONT></P>

        "Mr. President," I replied, "my losses would not be heavy, anymore than 
        they have been in the past. The days of the frontal attack should be

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>At 3.40 on 
        Sunday morning, December 8, 1941, Manila time, a long-distance telephone 
        call from Washington told me of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, but 
        no details were given. It was our strongest military position in the 
        Pacific. Its garrison was a mighty one, with America's best aircraft on 
        strongly defended fields, adequate warning systems, anti-aircraft 
        batteries, backed up by our Pacific Fleet. My first impression was that 
        the Japanese might well have suffered a serious setback.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>We had only 
        one radar station operative and had to rely for air warning largely on 
        eye and ear. At 9:30 a.m. our reconnaissance planes reported a force of 
        enemy bombers over Lingayen Gulf heading toward Manila. Major General 
        Lewis H. Brereton, who had complete tactical control of the Far East Air 
        Force, immediately ordered pursuit planes up to intercept them. But the 
        enemy bombers veered off without contact.</FONT></P>

        report reached me, I was still under the impression that the Japanese 
        had suffered a setback at Pearl Harbor, and their failure to close in on 
        me supported that belief. I therefore contemplated an air reconnaissance 
        to the north, using bombers with fighter protection, to ascertain a true 
        estimate of the situation and to exploit any possible weaknesses that 
        might develop on the enemy's front. But subsequent events quickly and 
        decisively changed my mind. I learned, to my astonishment, that the 
        Japanese had succeeded in their Hawaiian attack, and at 11:45 a report 
        came in of an over- powering enemy formation closing in on Clark Field. 
        Our fighters went up to meet them, but our bombers were slow in taking 
        off and our losses were heavy. Our force was simply too small to smash 
        the odds against them.</FONT></P>

        Formosa. He did not see that Luzon, including Manila Bay, had advantages 
        that were not possessed by other areas in the Philippines that could be 
        taken for a base at less cost in lives and material. As the discussions 
        progressed, however, the Navy Commander in the Pacific admitted that 
        developments might indicate a necessity for occupation of the Manila 
        area. Nimitz said that he had sufficient forces to carry out either 
        operation. It was highly pleasing and unusual to find two commanders who 
        were not demanding reinforcements.</FONT></P>

        at his best as he tactfully steered the discussion from one point to 
        another and narrowed down the area of disagreement between MacArthur and 
        Nimitz. The discussion remained on a friendly basis the entire time, and 
        in the end only a relatively minor difference remained - that of an 
        operation to retake the Philippine capital, Manila. This was solved 
        later, when the idea of beginning our Philippine invasion at Leyte was 
        suggested, studied and adopted.</FONT></P>

        were taken by surprise because, as General MacArthur explained in his

        island of Mindanao, south of Leyte. "The strategic results of the 
        capturing of the Philippines will be decisive." MacArthur said. " To the

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Shortly after 
        my arrival in Tokyo, I was urged by members of my staff to summon the 
        Emperor to my headquarters as a show of power. I brushed the suggestions 
        aside. "To do so," I explained, "would be to outrage the feelings of the 
        Japanese people and make a martyr of the Emperor in their 
        eyes.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>No, I shall 
        wait and in time the Emperor will voluntarily come to see me. In this 
        case, the patience of the East rather than the haste of the West will 
        best serve our purpose."</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The Emperor 
        did indeed shortly request an interview. In cutaway, striped trousers, 
        and top hat, riding in his Daimler with the imperial grand chamberlain 
        facing him on the jump seat, Hirohito arrived at the embassy. I had, 
        from the start of the occupation, directed that there should be no 
        derogation in his treatment. Every honor due a sovereign was to be his. 
        I met him cordially, and recalled that I had at one time been received 
        by his father at the close of the Russo-Japanese War. He was nervous and 
        the stress of the past months showed plainly. I dismissed everyone but 
        his own interpreter, and we sat down before an open fire at one end of 
        the long reception hall.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>I offered him 
        an American cigarette, which he took with thanks. I noticed how his 
        hands shook as I lighted it for him. I tried to make it as easy for him 
        as I could, but I knew how deep and dreadful must be his agony of 
        humiliation. I had an uneasy feeling he might plead his own cause 
        against indictment as a war criminal. There had been considerable outcry 
        from some of the Allies, notably the Russians and the British, to 
        include him in this category. Indeed, the initial list of those proposed 
        by them was headed by the Emperor's name. Realizing the tragic 
        consequences that would follow such an unjust action, I had stoutly 
        resisted such efforts. When Washington seemed to be veering toward the 
        British point of view, I had advised that I would need at least one 
        million reinforcements should such action be taken. I believed that if 
        the Emperor were indicted, and perhaps hanged, as a war criminal, 
        military government would have to be instituted throughout all Japan, 
        and guerrilla warfare would probably break out. The Emperor's name had 
        then been stricken from the list. But of all this he knew 
        nothing.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>But my fears 
        were groundless. What he said was this: "I come to you, General 
        MacArthur, to offer myself to the judgment of the powers you represent 
        as the one to bear sole responsibility for every political and military 
        decision made and action taken by my people in the conduct of war." A 
        tremendous impression swept me. This courageous assumption of a 
        responsibility implicit with death, a responsibility clearly belied by 
        facts of which I was fully aware, moved me to the very marrow of my 
        bones. He was an - Emperor by inherent birth, but in that instant I knew 
        I faced the First Gentleman of Japan in his own right.</FONT></P>

        of government directly subservient to the well-being of the

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>2. The 
        encouragement of the unionization of labor-that it may have an 
        influential voice in safeguarding the working man from exploitation and 
        abuse, and raising his living standard to a higher level.</FONT></P>

        which exist in the child labor practices.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>4. The 
        opening of the schools to more liberal education-that the people may 
        shape their future progress from factual knowledge and benefit from an 
        understanding of a system under which government becomes the servant 
        rather than the master of the people.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>5. The 
        abolition of systems which through secret inquisition and abuse have 
        held the people in constant fear-substituting therefor a system of 
        justice designed to afford the people protection against despotic, 
        arbitrary and unjust methods. Freedom of thought, freedom of speech, 
        freedom of religion must be maintained. Regimentation of the masses 
        under the guise or claim of efficiency, under whatever name of 
        government it may be made, must cease.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>6. The 
        democratization of Japanese economic institutions to the end that 
        monopolistic industrial controls be revised through the development of 
        methods which tend to insure a wide distribution of income and ownership 
        of the means of production and trade.</FONT></P>

        some mitigating circumstances on his behalf. I can find none. Rarely has 
        so cruel and wanton a record been spread to public gaze. Revolting as 
        this may be in itself, it pales before the sinister and far reaching 
        implication thereby attached to the profession of arms. The soldier, be

        threatens the very fabric of international society. The traditions of 
        fighting men are long and honorable. They are based upon the noblest of 
        human traits-sacrifice. This officer, of proven field merit, entrusted 
        with high command involving authority adequate to responsibility, has 
        failed this irrevocable standard; has failed his duty to his troops, to 
        his country, to his enemy, to mankind; has failed utterly his soldier 
        faith. The transgressions resulting therefrom as revealed by the trial 
        are a blot upon the military profession, a stain upon civilization and 
        constitute a memory of shame and dishonor that can never be forgotten. 
        Peculiarly callous and purposeless was the sack of the ancient city of

        conditions reversed had previously been spared.</FONT></P>

        proclaimed that I would "hold the Japanese Military authorities in the

        position near the 38th parallel. After inspecting his new command, he 
        felt he could repulse any enemy attempt to dislodge it. On New Year's 
        Day, however, the Reds launched a general offensive in tremendous force, 
        making penetrations of up to 12 miles. It forced the Eighth Army into 
        further withdrawal. By January 4th, the enemy had recaptured Seoul, and 
        by January 7th, the Eighth Army had retired to new positions roughly 70

        exchange of shocks and harsh words between Tokyo and 
        Washington.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>President 
        Truman circulated last December a firm, government-wide directive 
        declaring that any statement on foreign<BR>policy by any official or 
        employee of the government in a speech, article or other public 
        utterance, should be cleared with<BR>the State Department. Informants 
        said today that order was called to MacArthur's attention at that 
        time.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Friday night, 
        Washington time, MacArthur left Tokyo for the Thirty-eighth Parallel 
        area of Korea to order United Nations forces to cross into North Korea 
        as tactical requirements made necessary. Before leaving Tokyo he issued 
        a statement to the press.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>In this 
        statement he made a bid for peace talks with his opposite number on the 
        Communist side, said the Chinese Reds were licked and incapable of 
        waging modem war and warned that if the United Nations launched attacks 
        on Chinese bases and coastal area the Red nation would probably suffer 
        military collapse.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>This 
        statement, a check showed, caught the State Department completely 
        unawares. It apparently also caught President Truman without advance 
        notice. After several hours of parleying, including a talk between 
        Secretary of State Acheson<BR>and Mr. Truman, a rather meaningless 
        statement was issued, designed to say on Saturday that Washington had 
        nothing to do with what MacArthur had declared Friday night.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The 
        statements said MacArthur had authority to conduct military operations 
        but that political issues which "he has stated are beyond his 
        responsibilities are being dealt with in the U.N. and by the governments 
        having troops in Korea."</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The key 
        MacArthur clause which set off the alarm here was that the United 
        Nations could probably succeed in forcing a<BR>military collapse of Red 
        China by a limited coastal attack and base-bombing war. A Tokyo dispatch 
        yesterday suggested MacArthur probably was trying to divert the Chinese 
        Reds' attention from Korea to the danger of a coastal attack.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Whatever his 
        objective, any statement he makes - even mingled in with "ifs" - about 
        extending the war in the Far East always sends huge shudders among the 
        Canadian, French, British and other friendly governments. When the 
        Europeans come in to the State Department wanting to know "what does 
        MacArthur propose to do," Acheson and his aides get upset about the 
        problems of holding together the political side of the coalition of 
        which MacArthur is military commander.</FONT></P>

        from his head-over-heels plunge toward the Chinese border and disaster 
        in Korea. The chiefs could already look at the map and recognize that 
        MacArthur had arrayed his troops as for a parade, divided their columns 
        and left between them the mountain where enemies could assemble in peace 
        and await the securest chance for war. The chiefs had passed the hours 
        helplessly struggling between their awe of a commander who had been 
        riding with the Cavalry when they were in rompers and their awareness of 
        his terminal folly. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Ridgway was 
        then only deputy Chief of Staff and forbidden to speak up in the company 
        of his superiors. Crisis compelled him to break the laws of silence at 
        last. "We owe it to ourselves," he said, to call MacArthur to halt; and 
        it must be done now because even tomorrow could be too late. The chiefs 
        sustained the shock of this breach of Old Army custom and continued to 
        sit inert until what they knew might happen did and all too soon.

        urgings that MacArthur be curbed. "Oh, what's the use," Vandenberg 
        replied. "He won't listen." And, thereafter of course, it would be for 
        Ridgway to restore the ruin of the Korean campaign.<BR></FONT></P>
