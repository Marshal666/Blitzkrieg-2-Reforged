        the bombing "turned out entirely to the tactical benefit of the Germans. 
        For after that they felt free to occupy the ruins, and the rubble 
        provided mud better defensive cover than the monastery would have been 
        before its destruction. As anyone with experience of street-fighting 
        knows, it is only when buildings are demolished that they are converted

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>At 
        Charleville, on 24 May, when the B.E.F. was absolutely ripe for the 
        plucking, Hitler informed his astonished generals that Britain was 
        'indispensable' to the world and that he had therefore resolved to 
        respect her integrity and, if possible, ally himself with her. Perhaps a 
        less fanciful explanation of Hitler's attitude is supplied by 
        Ribbentrop's representative at the Fuhrer's headquarters, who has left 
        on record the comment: "Hitler personally intervened to allow the 
        British to escape. He was convinced that to destroy their army would be 
        to force them to fight to the bitter end."</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>On the 
        military side the facts are clearer. On 23 May Field-Marshal von 
        Rundstedt, commanding Army Group A, halted<BR>General Guderian's XIX 
        Army Corps when two of its panzer divisions were heading for Dunkirk, 
        not twenty miles distant and with little or no opposition ahead. The 
        British counter-attack at Arras on 21 May, though undertaken by no more 
        than two mixed columns, each comprising a tank battalion, an infantry 
        battalion, a field battery, an anti-tank battery, and a machine-gun 
        company, had caused him some concern. He therefore called the halt in 
        order to "allow the situation to clarify itself and keep our forces 
        concentrated". The panzers had just reached the Channel, and the success 
        of this British counterattack engendered the fear of a larger operation 
        that would cut them off from their supporting infantry. The next morning 
        he received a visit from the Fuhrer, who confirmed the stop order. The 
        panzers were not to be risked in a possibly flooded area but preserved 
        for future operations-presumably against the French Army. On the other 
        hand, the Luftwaffe's 'field of action' was not to be

        the available evidence, there can be little doubt that it was at the 
        particular instance of the Luftwaffe's commander-in-chief, Field-Marshal 
        Goering, that in the upshot the B.E.F. Was "left to the Luftwaffe". 
        Guderian was to write, bitterly, of the first day of the evacuation, 26 
        May: "We watched the Luftwaffe attack. We saw also the armada of great 
        and little ships, by means of which the British were evacuating their 
        forces." Guderian's bitterness was shared by the whole of the German 
        Army High Command.</FONT></P>

        that the retention of Rangoon was impossible with the forces at my 
        disposal, dispersed as they were and with half of them already 
        encircled. The day after my arrival I therefore ordered the evacuation 
        to begin at daylight the following morning, and the demolition of the 
        port and its installations to be carried out thereafter as quickly as 
        possible. I could not save Rangoon but I could save the Army, with luck. 
        The loss of our base would be a most serious matter, as we should have 
        to depend on the scattered stores and dumps spread about in central and 
        northern Burma. When these were used up, the Army would be crippled 
        unless supplies could be sent in over the mountains from India; but, 
        apart from a few mule tracks, communication with India was non-existent. 
        It seemed that we must do the best with what we had. With Chinese 
        assistance-however doubtful-we should be able at least to make the 
        Japanese advance into Burma slow and costly. Such were the thoughts in 
        my mind when I ordered the destruction and evacuation of

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>My first step 
        in restoring morale, therefore, was to lay down the firm principle, to 
        be made known to all ranks, that no further withdrawal was contemplated 
        and that we would fight the coming battle on the ground on which we 
        stood. General Montgomery fully concurred in this policy, and 
        communicated it to the Eighth Army H.Q. staff at a meeting held on the 
        second evening of his arrival; and it went out to him as a written 
        directive when I formally took over the Middle East command.</FONT></P>

        a first-class trainer and leader of troops on the battlefield, with a 
        fine tactical sense. He knows how to win the loyalty of his men and has 
        a great flair for raising morale. He rightly boasted that, after the 
        battle of Alamein, he never suffered a defeat; and the truth is that he 
        never intended to run the risk of a defeat; that is one reason why he 
        was cautious and reluctant to take chances. There is, however, much to 
        be said for his attitude when we consider that, up to October 1942, we 
        had not won a single major battle since the start of the war - except 
        Archie Wavell's operations against the Italians and some local victories 
        against the Axis forces in the Western Desert.</FONT></P>

        disguise that he was not an easy man to deal with; for example, 
        administrative orders issued by my staff were sometimes objected to - in

        do what he liked. Still, no serious difficulties arose over these very

        publicity build-up had been enormous. There is no question that the 
        Field-Marshal was a most able battle commander and a fine tactician for 
        an independent force like the Afrika Korps, but it was hardly necessary

        and was also heavily defended and under the fighter umbrella of the

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>They were two 
        completely contrasted military characters; the one impatient of 
        inaction, the other unwilling to commit himself to active operations 
        unless he could clearly see their purpose. On one of my visits to the 
        American head-<BR>quarters, I was fascinated to hear this characteristic 
        exchange:</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Patton: Why 
        are we sitting down doing nothing? We must do something!</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Both were 
        good soldiers. Patton was a thruster, prepared to take any risks; 
        Bradley, as I have indicated, was more cautious. Patton should have 
        lived during the Napoleonic wars - he would have been a splendid Marshal 
        under Napoleon.</FONT></P>

        all his bravura and toughness and terrific drive General George Patton

        historical postscript can now be added to the much discussed question of 
        the destruction of the historic Benedictine Monastery on Monte Cassino 
        as a preliminary step in the Allied offensive there in February. The 
        task was carried out by a large force of American bombers and supporting 
        artillery. According to the announcements of the Allied Command at the 
        time this destruction was ordered because the Monastery, which dominated 
        the approaches to the town, had been "occupied and fortified" by the 
        Germans. These statements were repeated in Field-Marshal Sir H. Maitland 
        Wilson's report published in 1946 - which seemed strange in view of 
        earlier testimony from the Vatican and the Abbot himself that the 
        Germans had avoided trespassing on the Monastery, despite the tactical 
        disadvantage which this involved for them. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The irony of 
        the bombing was, as both Senger and Vietinghoff remarked, that it turned 
        out entirely to the tactical benefit of the Germans. For after that they 
        felt free to occupy the ruins, and the rubble provided mud better 
        defensive cover than the Monastery would have been before its 
        destruction. "As anyone with experience of street-fighting knows, it is 
        only when buildings are demolished that they are converted from 
        mouse-traps into bastions of defence." Batteries posted and concealed in 
        the ruins were able to enfilade and break up the subsequent British 
        attempts to drive through to the town of Cassino.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The battle 
        for Cassino-or rather the series of battles for Cassino - began on 17 
        January 1944, when X Corps attacked across the Garigliano. On 20 
        January, United States II Corps attacked across the Rapido, but this 
        blow failed and X Corps, after meeting with some initial success, were 
        checked by heavy counter-attacks. One more attack began on 16 February, 
        and it was this assault that was preceded by the destruction of the 
        monastery by bombing and artillery fire. But Cassino town and the 
        monastery were not to be captured until 18 May, when the Poles raised 
        the red and white standard with the white eagle over the ruins of the 
        monastery.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Till the 
        February bombardment, the great Benedictine monastery had been spared 
        deliberately, to our detriment. Whether the Germans took advantage of 
        its deep cellars for shelter and its high windows for observation I do 
        not know; but it was obvious that this huge and massive building offered 
        the defenders considerable protection from hostile fire, merely by their 
        sheltering under its walls. As Winston Churchill has observed, the enemy 
        fortifications were hardly separate from the building itself.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Was the 
        destruction of the monastery a military necessity? Was it morally wrong 
        to destroy it?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The answer to 
        the first question is 'yes'. It was necessary more for the effect it 
        would have on the morale of the attackers than for purely material 
        reasons.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The answer to 
        the second question is this: when soldiers are fighting for a just cause 
        and are prepared to suffer death and mutilation in the process, bricks 
        and mortar, no matter how venerable, cannot be allowed to weigh against 
        human lives. Every good commander must consider the morale and feelings 
        of his fighting men, and, what is equally important, the fighting men 
        must know that their whole existence is in the hands of a man in whom 
        they have complete confidence. Thus the commanding general must make it 
        absolutely clear to his troops that they go into action under the most 
        favourable conditions he has the power to order.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>In the 
        context of the Cassino battle, how could a structure which dominated the 
        fighting field be allowed to stand? The monastery had to be destroyed. 
        Withal, everything was done to save the lives of the monks and their 
        treasures: ample warning was given of the bombing.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The great 
        Benedictine monastery, from which a magnificent view of the surrounding 
        country can be gained, has been completely rebuilt in cut stone. Both 
        outside and in, it has been restored to its former condition, even down 
        to the marble work and interior decoration.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The bombs of

        war, an ability to get along with people, and sound tactical 
        conceptions. He is self-effacing and energetic. The only possible doubt 
        that could be raised<BR>with respect to his qualifications is a 
        suspected unsureness in dealing with certain of his subordinates. At 
        times it seems that he alters his own plans and ideas merely to meet an 
        objection or a suggestion of a subordinate, so as to avoid direct 
        command methods. This, I must say, is only a feeling. I have no proof 
        that in the cases where he has apparently changed his mind rather 
        radically that he was swayed by anything except further reflection on 
        the problem.<BR></FONT></P>

        Campaign</A>. </FONT><BR></B></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Anzio played 
        a vital role in the capture of Rome by giving me the means to employ a 
        double-handed punch - from the beachhead and from Cassino - which caught 
        the Germans in a pincer movement. Without this double-handed punch I do 
        not believe we should ever have been able to break through the German 
        defences at Cassino.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Orders for 
        the operation were issued on 2 January. The objective was defined as to 
        cut the enemy communications and threaten the German rear. Fifth Army 
        was ordered to make "as strong a thrust as possible towards Cassino and 
        Frosinone shortly before the assault landing to draw in enemy reserves 
        that might be employed against the landing forces and then to create a 
        breach in his front through which every opportunity will be taken to 
        link up rapidly with the seaborne operation". Despite the switch, in 
        all, of five divisions from Eighth Army to the Fifth Army, German 
        resistance on the main front remained stubborn; and during the early 
        critical days the British and United States divisions at Anzio had to 
        fight unaided for their own salvation. Meanwhile, on the Adriatic 
        sector. General Montgomery had continued with his attempt to break 
        through the enemy's defensive system; but with even less success as the 
        weather worsened and the enemy's strength increased.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Against a 
        less formidable foe an operation such as we had devised would have 
        succeeded; but I think we may well have underestimated the remarkable 
        resilience and toughness of the Germans, in expecting them to be 
        frightened by such a threat to their rear. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Hitler's 
        orders to Kesselring were to hold on to Cassino at all costs, for 
        political reasons, and to eliminate the Anzio landing. The withdrawal of 
        the Hermann Goring division from Italy was cancelled, and Hitler told 
        Kesselring that he would be reinforced by two motorized divisions, three 
        independent regiments, two heavy tank battalions and some heavy and 
        medium artillery units. Thus the enemy refused to weaken his battlefront 
        at Cassino by drawing back formations to deal with the 
        landings.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Every time we 
        attacked Kesselring in Italy we took him completely by surprise; but he 
        showed very great skill in extricating himself from the desperate 
        situations into which his faulty intelligence had led him. I feel now 
        that he would not, in these circumstances, have altered his dispositions 
        on the main front to any great degree until he had tried every means to 
        eliminate the threat to his rear. Nor need his determination be doubted. 
        The forces under his command had been engaged in a continuous retreat 
        for almost a year since November 1942, a retreat that had brought them 
        just short of Alexandria to just north of Naples - and it was time to 
        put a stop to it. <BR><BR><BR></FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Twenty-six 
        nations contributed contingents to my command in Italy. I feel, 
        therefore, it will be agreed that I speak from first-hand experience of 
        the varying fighting qualities of troops in battle when I affirm that 
        there are no better soldiers than those of the British race, provided 
        they have a cause worth fighting for - and dying for, if 
        necessary.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>They object 
        to being pushed around - they are intelligent enough to want to know 
        what it is all about and they will become<BR>unhappy and disgruntled if 
        they feel that unfairness exists. Yet, if their leaders are worthy of 
        them, they will follow them anywhere. They are very patient and tough in 
        defence. Yet though the British will go into the attack with great 
        bravery and tenacity, as a whole they are not quick to exploit a success 
        or to react to a sudden emergency.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>British 
        military leaders are reluctant to accept heavy losses unless the scales 
        of victory are weighted in their favour. This attitude of mind no doubt 
        results from our experiences in the first world war, when our enormous 
        casualties in such battles as the Somme and Passchendaele gave us 
        nothing more than a few square miles of French territory, and sometimes 
        achieved an advance of no more than a few yards.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>And what of 
        the foe that our soldiers and those of our allies overcame and mastered? 
        Having fought against the Germans in two world wars I cannot conceal my 
        regard for their ability as fighting men. They are very brave and tough, 
        and have a marked sense of duty and discipline. Furthermore, they take 
        pride in mastering their weapons and learning their job on the 
        battlefield.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>If the 
        Germans are a warrior race, they are certainly militarist also. I think 
        they love the military pageant and the panoply of war; and the feeling 
        of strength and power that a well-organized and disciplined unit gives 
        to each and every individual member of that unit. I am quite willing to 
        admit that I myself share this curious attraction for the strength and 
        elegance of beautifully trained and equipped formations, with all the 
        art and subtlety of their movements in action against an enemy. I can 
        well understand the enthusiasm which the soldiers-from marshals to the 
        private soldier - showed for Napoleon; and why they followed their 
        leader without doubt or question in his victorious campaigns. Feeling 
        thus, they shared the glory of his conquests.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>I can also 
        understand the German soldier's high morale when Hitler seemed 
        invincible; but I think it very remarkable that they fought their last 
        battles just as toughly and bravely as when they were winning their 
        first-although they must have realized that all was lost. The last 
        battles in Italy were just as bitter as any we had experienced in the 
        Western Desert, or in the earlier stages of the Italian campaign. Like 
        the boxer in the ring, the German soldier didn't give up until he was 
        knocked out: and make no mistake about it, he was!<BR><BR></FONT></P>
