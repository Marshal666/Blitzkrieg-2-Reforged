        Wingate joined the intelligence staff in Palestine. He was responsible 
        for organizing, training and leading raids against Arab terrorist bases 
        before being wounded in July 1938. After recovering from his injuries he

        organized raids against Italian units on the Abyssinian border. With 
        only a few hundred men Wingate bluffed 12,000 Italians into surrender. 
        Wingate then joined up with General <A
