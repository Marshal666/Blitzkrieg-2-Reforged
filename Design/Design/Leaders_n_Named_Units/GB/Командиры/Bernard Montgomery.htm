        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Over the next 
        six weeks Montgomery began to stockpile vast quantities of weapons and 
        ammunition to make sure that by the time he attacked he possessed 
        overwhelming firepower. By the middle of October the Eighth Army 
        totalled 195,000 men, 1,351 tanks and 1,900 pieces of artillery. This 
        included large numbers of recently delivered <A

        The attack came at the worst time for the <A

        defended their positions well and after two days the Eighth Army had

        Rommel</A> returned he launched a counterattack at Kidney Depression 
        (27th October). Montgomery now returned to the offensive and the 9th

        ignored these criticisms and instead made plans for a new offensive, 
        Operation Supercharge. </FONT></P>

        Afrika Korps</A> at Kidney Ridge. After initially resisting the attack, 
        Rommel decided he no longer had the resources to hold his line and on 
        the 3rd November he ordered his troops to withdraw. However, <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERhitler.htm">Adolf

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The next day 
        Montgomery ordered his men forward. The Eighth Army broke through the

        Rommel</A>, in danger of being surrounded, was forced to retreat. Those

        unable to move fast enough and were taken prisoner.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>For a while 
        it looked like the the British would cut off Rommel's army but a sudden

        entrance to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, was by competitive 
        examination. There was first a qualifying examination in which it was 
        necessary to show a certain minimum standard of mental ability; the 
        competitive examination followed a year or so later. These two hurdles 
        were negotiated without difficulty, and in the competitive examination 
        my place was 72 out of some 170 vacancies. I was astonished to find 
        later that a large number of my fellow cadets had found it necessary to 
        leave school early and go to a crammer in order to ensure success in the 
        competitive entrance examination.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>In those days 
        the Army did not attract the best brains in the country. Army life was 
        expensive and it was not possible to live on one's pay. It was generally 
        considered that a private income or allowance of at<BR>least £100 a year 
        was necessary, even in one of the so-called less fashionable County 
        regiments. In the cavalry, and in the more fashionable infantry 
        regiments, an income of up to £300 or £400 was demanded before one was 
        accepted. These financial matters were not known to me when I decided on 
        the Army as my career; nobody had explained them to me or to my parents. 
        I learned them at Sandhurst when it became necessary to consider the 
        regiment of one's choice, and this was not until about halfway through 
        the course at the college.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The fees at 
        Sandhurst were £150 a year for the son of a civilian and this included 
        board and lodging, and all necessary expenses. But additional pocket 
        money was essential and after some discussion my<BR>parents agreed to 
        allow me £2 a month; tills was also to continue in the holidays, making 
        my personal income £24 a year.</FONT></P>

        attention from the Germans. But a soldier ran to me and began to put a 
        field dressing on my wound; he was shot through the head by a sniper and 
        collapsed on top of me. The sniper continued to fire at us and I got a 
        second wound in the knee; the soldier received many bullets intended for 
        me. No further attempt was made by my platoon to rescue us; indeed, it 
        was presumed we were both dead. When it was dark the stretcher-bearers 
        came to carry us in; the soldier was dead and I was in a bad way. I was 
        taken back to the Advanced dressing Station; the doctors reckoned I 
        could not live and, as the station was shortly to move, a grave was dug 
        for me. But when the time came to move I was still alive; so I was put 
        in a motor ambulance and sent back to a hospital. </FONT></P>

        Passchendaele Ridge and see the country. When he saw the mud and the 
        ghastly conditions under which the soldiers had fought and died, he was 
        horrified and said: "Do you mean to tell me that the soldiers had to 
        fight under such conditions?" And when he was told that it was so, he

        reasonable, views about the conduct of future war. As a stranger in a 
        strange land I kept my own counsel, but I left the course with a very 
        definite impression that in Monty we certainly had a soldier who knew 
        his onions, no matter what the "high-ups" in the army might officially 
        think of the smell.</FONT></P>

        pride-myself that Monty, who is only too willing to learn anything new

        co-operation from me, during his very short term of office in Palestine 
        in 1939. It was short, because he was taken desperately ill not long 
        after his arrival in the country and left for home on a stretcher. 
        Knowing that more serious war was close upon us, I thought with dismay 
        that we<BR>were to lose a man whom I considered to be one of our best

        hours when I was told that the divisional commander. General Montgomery,

        come up at once to cast an eye over his new divisional machine-gun 
        commander. This was my first meeting with him. I saw a small, alert 
        figure with piercing eyes sitting in the back of his car - the man under 
        whom I was to fight all my battles during the war, and who was to have 
        more influence on my life than anyone before or since.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>I knew him 
        well by reputation. He was probably the most discussed general in the 
        British Army before the war, and-except with those who had served under 
        him - not a popular figure. Regular armies in all countries tend to 
        produce a standard type of officer, but Monty, somehow or other, didn't 
        fit into the British<BR>pattern. His methods of training and command 
        were unorthodox, always a deadly crime in military circles. He was known 
        to be ruthlessly efficient, but somewhat of a showman. I had been told 
        sympathetically that I wouldn't last long under his command, and, to be 
        honest, I would rather have served under any other divisional

        of operations; this was based on the fact that at all costs the Eighth 
        Army was to be preserved "in being" and must not be destroyed in battle. 
        If Rommel attacked in strength, as was expected soon, the Eighth Army 
        would fall back on the Delta; if Cairo and the Delta could not be held,

        devoted to him. I have great confidence in him as a combat commander. He 
        is intelligent, a good talker, and has a flare for showmanship. Like all 
        other senior British officers, he has been most loyal - personally and

        color=#8080ff>(8) In Italy in 1943 Bernard Montgomery commented on the 
        importance of air support during modern battles. 
        </FONT></B><BR><BR></B>I believe that the first and great principle of 
        war is that you must first win your air battle before you fight your 
        land and sea battle. If you examine the conduct of the campaign from 
        Alamein through Tunisia, Sicily and Italy you will find I have never 
        fought a land battle until the air battle has been won. We never had to 
        bother about the enemy air, because we won the air battle 
        first.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The second 
        great principle is that Army plus Air has to be so knitted that the two 
        together from one entity. If you do that, the resultant military effort 
        will be so great that nothing will be able to stand against 
        it.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The third 
        principle is that the Air Force command. I hold that it is quite wrong 
        for the soldier to want to exercise command over the air striking 
        forces. The handling of an Air Force is a life-study, and therefore the 
        air part must be kept under Air Force command.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>The Desert 
        Air Force and the Eighth Army are one. We do not understand the meaning 
        of "army cooperation". When you are one entity you cannot cooperate. If 
        you knit together the power of the Army on the land and the power of the 
        Air in the sky, then nothing will stand against you and you will never 
        lose a battle. </FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>One of the 
        most fascinating studies of the last war was the contrast between these 
        two great commanders, Montgomery and Rommel, each in his own way an 
        outstanding general, yet utterly and absolutely different in almost 
        every respect. Rommel was probably the best armoured corps commander 
        produced by either side. Utterly fearless, full of drive and initiative, 
        he was always up in front where the battle was fiercest. If his opponent 
        made a mistake, Rommel was on to it like a flash, and he never hesitated 
        to take personal command of a regiment or battalion if he thought fit. 
        On one occasion he was found lifting mines with his own hands. His 
        popularity with the soldiers was immense, but a great many officers 
        resented his interference with their commands.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>All this 
        reads like the copybook general but, in point of fact, this is not the 
        best way to control a swift-moving, modern battle. Very often at a 
        critical moment no one could find Rommel, because he was conducting 
        personally some battalion attack. He tended to become so involved in 
        some minor action that he failed to appreciate the general picture of 
        the battlefield. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Monty was not 
        such a dashing, romantic figure as his opponent; nor would you find him 
        leading a forlorn hope in person, for the simple reason that if he was 
        in command forlorn hopes did not occur. He had an extraordinary capacity 
        for putting his finger straight on the essentials of any problem, and of 
        being able to explain them simply and clearly. He planned all his 
        battles most carefully - and then put them out of his mind every night. 
        I believe he was awakened in the night only half a dozen times during 
        the whole war.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Their 
        handling of the battle of Alam Haifa makes the contrast clear. Having 
        made the best possible plan to win the battle, yet at the same time to 
        husband his resources, Monty dismissed Alam Haifa entirely from his mind 
        and concentrated on the next one.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>While Rommel 
        was leading his troops in person against strongly-held defensive 
        positions on the Alam Halfa ridge, Montgomery was planning the battle of 
        Alamein. That was the difference between the two. <BR><BR></FONT></P>

        Campaign</A></FONT></B><FONT 
        color=#8080ff>.</FONT><BR><BR></B>Eisenhower complained that Dempsey was 
        leaving all the fighting to the Americans. His attention was drawn to my 
        basic strategy, i.e. to fight hard on my left and draw Germans on to 
        that flank whilst I pushed with my right. It was pointed out that he had 
        approved this strategy and that it was being carried out; the bulk of 
        the German armour had continuously been kept on the British front. 
        Eisenhower could not refute these arguments. He then asked why it was we 
        could not launch major offensives on each army front simultaneously - as 
        the Russians did. It was pointed out to him that the German density in 
        Normandy was about 2.5 times that of the Russian front, and our 
        superiority in strength was only in the nature of some 25 per cent as 
        compared to the 300 per cent Russian superiority on the eastern front. 
        We clearly were not in a position to launch an all-out offensive along 
        the whole front; such a procedure would be exactly what the Germans 
        would like and would not be in accord with our agreed strategy. We had 
        already (on the 25th July) launched the break-out operation on the right 
        flank. It was an all-out offensive; it was gathering momentum rapidly. 
        The British Second Army was fighting to keep the Germans occupied on the 
        left flank. Our strategy was at last about to reap its full reward. What 
        was the trouble?</FONT></P>

        he was a great Supreme Commander - a military statesman. I know of no 
        other person who could have welded the allied forces into such a fine

        Market Garden</A> in his autobiography, <I>The Memoirs of Field Marshal 
        Montgomery</I> (1958) </FONT></B><BR><BR></B>Operation Market Garden was 
        duly launched on the 17th September 1944. It has been described by many 
        writers. I will not go over it all again. We did not, as everyone knows, 
        capture that final bridgehead north of Arnhem. As a result we could not 
        position the Second Army north of the Neder Rijn at Arnem, and thus 
        place it in a suitable position to be able to develop operations against 
        the north face of the Ruhr. But the possession of the crossings over the 
        Meuse at Grave, and over the Lower Rhine (or Waal as it is called in 
        Holland) at Nijmegen, were to prove of immense value later on; we had 
        liberated a large part of Holland; we had the stepping stone we needed 
        for the successful battles of the Rhineland that were to follow. Without 
        these successes we would not have been able to cross the Rhine in 
        strength in March 1945 - but we did not get our final bridgehead, and 
        that must be admitted.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>There were 
        many reasons why we did not gain complete success at Arnhem. The 
        following in my view were the main ones.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>First. The 
        operation was not regarded at Supreme Headquarters as the spearhead of a 
        major Allied movement on the northern flank designed to isolate, and 
        finally to occupy, the Ruhr - the one objective in the West which the 
        Germans could not afford to lose. There is no doubt in my mind that 
        Elsenhower always wanted to give priority to the northern thrust and to 
        scale down the southern one. He ordered this to be done, and he thought 
        that it was being done. It was not<BR>being done. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Second. The 
        airborne forces at Arnhem were dropped too far away from the vital 
        objective - the bridge. It was some hours before they reached it. I take 
        the blame for this mistake. I should have ordered Second Army and 1st 
        Airborne Corps to arrange that at least one complete Parachute Brigade 
        was dropped quite close to the bridge, so that it could have been 
        captured in a matter of minutes and its defence soundly organised with 
        time to spare. I did not do so.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Third. The 
        weather. This turned against us after the first day and we could not 
        carry out much of the later airborne programme. But weather is always an 
        uncertain factor, in war and in peace. This uncertainty we all accepted. 
        It could only have been offset, and the operation made a certainty, by 
        allotting additional resources to the project, so that it became an 
        Allied and not merely a British project.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Fourth. The 
        and S.S. Panzer Corps was refitting in the Arnhem. area, having limped 
        up there after its mauling in Normandy. We knew it was there. But we 
        were wrong in supposing that it could not fight effectively; its battle 
        state was far beyond our expectation. It was quickly brought into action 
        against the 1st Airborne Division.</FONT></P>

        Montgomery. </B></FONT><BR></B></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Montgomery is 
        a first-class trainer and leader of troops on the battlefield, with a 
        fine tactical sense. He knows how to win the loyalty of his men and has 
        a great flair for raising morale. He rightly boasted that, after the 
        battle of Alamein, he never suffered a defeat; and the truth is that he 
        never intended to run the risk of a defeat; that is one reason why he 
        was cautious and reluctant to take chances. There is, however, much to 
        be said for his attitude when we consider that, up to October 1942, we 
        had not won a single major battle since the start of the war - except 
        Archie Wavell's operations against the Italians and some local victories 
        against the Axis forces in the Western Desert.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Yet I can't 
        disguise that he was not an easy man to deal with; for example, 
        administrative orders issued by my staff were sometimes objected to - in 
        other words Monty wanted to have complete independence of command and to 
        do what he liked. Still, no serious difficulties arose over these very 
        minor disturbances, he was always reasonable when tackled.</FONT></P>
