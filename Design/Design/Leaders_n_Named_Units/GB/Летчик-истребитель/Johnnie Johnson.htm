        emerged as an outstanding fighter pilot. A master of accurate deflection 
        shooting, a skill he had developed as a child when he hunted rabbits 
        with a shotgun. In September 1941 Johnson was promoted to flight 
        lieutenant and was given command of B Flight. </FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In 1937, Johnnie Johnson 
        tried to join the Auxiliary Air Force (AAF). On hearing that he came 
        from Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire, the interviewing officer said, "My 
        dear chap, you've just the type. Which hunt do you follow?" When Johnnie 
        said he did not even ride a horse, he was promptly shown the door. 
        Little did that that interviewing officer think he had just rejected the 
        man who, in the second world war, would shoot down more of the enemy 
        than any other pilot in the RAF - and without ever being shot down 
        himself. </FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Focke-Wulf 190 was 
        undoubtedly, the best German fighter. We were puzzled by the unfamiliar 
        silhouette, for these new German fighters seemed to have squarer 
        wingtips and more tapering fuselages than the Messerschmitts we usually 
        encountered. We saw that the new aircraft had radial engines and a mixed 
        armament of cannons and machine-guns, all firing from wing 
        positions.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Whatever these strange 
        fighters were, they gave us a hard time of it. They seemed to be faster 
        in a zoom climb than the Me 109, and far more stable in a vertical dive. 
        They also turned better. The first time we saw them we all had our work 
        cut out to shake them off, and we lost several pilots. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Back at our fighter base 
        and encouraged by our enthusiastic Intelligence Officers, we drew 
        sketches and side views of this strange new aeroplane. We were all 
        agreed that it was superior to the Me 109f and completely outclassed our 
        Spitfire Vs. Our sketches disappeared into mysterious Intelligence 
        channels and we heard no more of the matter,. But from then on, fighter 
        pilots continually reported increasing numbers of these outstanding 
        fighters over northern France. </FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">At this time the Spitfire 
        IX was the best air fighter in the world. In my view it was not suitable 
        for beating up the ground targets because its Merlin engine was cooled 
        by a liquid called Glycol, which was held in a small tank just below the 
        propellor. This Glycol tank and the radiator were always exposed to 
        ground fire, at which the Germans were very adept. A single machine-gun 
        bullet through either the radiator or the Glycol tank meant that the 
        engine caught fire or seized up within a matter of a very few minutes. 
        After four years of air fighting, and still remaining sound in wind and 
        limb, the prospect of being shot down by a few rounds fired by some 
        half-baked Kraut gunner did not appeal to me in the least!</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The first time I saw my 
        lean and graceful Spitfire with two 500 lb. bombs hanging beneath its 
        slender wings, it seemed to me that she was intolerably burned, and that 
        the ugly blunt bombs were a basic contradiction of all the beauty and 
        symmetry of the aircraft. It was like seeing a beautiful racehorse 
        harnessed to a farm cart.</FONT></P>

        War</A>. </FONT></B></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Johnnie Johnson's 
        performance was even more creditable because he largely missed the 
        Battle of Britain and won his "kills" in fighter-to-fighter combat 
        rather than against heavy bombers. Johnnie's kills were hard-earned, but 
        then Johnson had the two skills needed to be successful; he was a good 
        shot and a good pilot. Lots of people were good pilots, but Johnnie was 
        also a good shot - gifted in the art of deflection shooting.</FONT></P>

        Johnnie Johnson, <I>Wing Leader</I> (1956)</FONT></B></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It is fascinating to watch 
        the reactions of the various pilots. They fall into two broad 
        categories; those who are going out to shoot and those who secretly and 
        desperately know they will be shot at, the hunters and the hunted. The 
        majority of the pilots, once they have seen their name on the board, 
        walk out to their Spitfires for a pre-flight check and for a word or two 
        with their ground crews. They tie on their mae-wests, check their maps, 
        study the weather forecast and have a last-minute chat with their 
        leaders or wingmen. These are the hunters.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hunted, that very small 
        minority (although every squadron usually possessed at least one), 
        turned to their escape kits and made quite sure that they were wearing 
        the tunic with the silk maps sewn into a secret hiding-place; that they 
        had at least one oilskin-covered packet of French francs, and two if 
        possible; that they had a compass and a revolver and sometimes specially 
        made clothes to assist their activities once they were shot down. When 
        they went through these agonized preparations they reminded me of aged 
        countrywomen meticulously checking their shopping- lists before catching 
        the bus for the market town.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In the autumn of 1942, Wing 
        Commander Jackie Darwin took over cornmand of 244 Wing, composed of two 
        squadrons of Spitfires and two of Hurricanes. Darwin was a regular 
        officer who before the war had served on the North-West Frontier of 
        India and was also a keen follower to hounds. By a tragic misfortune he 
        was dancing with his beautiful wife in the Cafe de Paris in London the 
        night it was bombed, and she was killed in his arms. He never recovered 
        fully from this shock, and developed a great hatred for the Germans and 
        a complete disregard for his own safety. His pilots did not think much 
        of flying next to him, for he always led them through the thickest of 
        the flak, and whereas for sometime he bore a charmed life, his wingmen 
        were not always so lucky.<BR></FONT></P>
