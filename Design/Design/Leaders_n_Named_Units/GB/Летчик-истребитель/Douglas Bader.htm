        became more vulnerable to bombing attacks.</FONT></P>

        suited Bader and during the summer of 1941 he obtained 12 kills. His 23

        Douglas Bader first flew a </FONT><FONT color=#000000><A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWspitfire.htm">Supermarine 
        Spitfire</A></FONT> <FONT color=#8080ff>in February, 1940. He wrote 
        about it in his book, <I>Fight for the Sky</I> 
        (1973).</FONT></B><BR><BR>The Spitfire looked good and was good. But my 
        first reaction was that it was bad for handling on the ground; its long 
        straight nose, uptilted when the tail wheel was on the ground; its long 
        straight nose, uptilted when the tail wheel was on the ground, made 
        taxing difficult since it was not easy to see ahead. It was necessary to 
        to swing from side to side to look in front. The view at take-off was 
        restricted in the same way until you were travelling fast enough to lift 
        the tail; only then could you see over the nose.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Once accustomed to these 
        minor inconveniences, they were no longer apparent, and once in the air, 
        you felt in the first few minutes that here was the aeroplane par 
        excellence. The controls were light, positive and synchronized; in fact, 
        the aeroplane of one's dreams. It was stable; it flew hands and feet 
        off; yet you could move it quickly and effortlessly into any attitude. 
        You brought it in to land at 75 mph and touched down at 60-65 mph. Its 
        maximum speed was 367 mph. You thus had a wide speed range which has not 
        been equalled before or since.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It had eight machine guns 
        of .303 calibre each, mounted four in each wing. The guns were spaced 
        one close to the fuselage, two mid-wing, one further out. The eight guns 
        were normally synchronized to 250 yards. In other words the four in each 
        wing were sighted so that the bullets from all eight converged at that 
        distance, in front of the Spitfire. Experienced fighter pilots used to 
        close the pattern to 200 yards. The successful pilots succeeded because 
        they did not open fire until they were close to the target.</FONT></P>

        <FONT color=#8080ff>in May, 1940.</FONT></B><BR><BR>We were all flying 
        around up and down the coast near Dunkirk looking for enemy aircraft 
        which seemed also to be milling around with no particular cohesion. The 
        sea from Dunkirk to Dover during these days of the evacuation looked 
        like any coastal road in England on a bank holiday. It was solid with 
        shipping. One felt one could walk across without getting one's feet wet, 
        or that's what it looked like from the air. There were naval escort 
        vessels, sailing dinghies, rowing boats, paddle-steamers, indeed every 
        floating device known in this country. They were all taking British 
        soldiers from Dunkirk back home. The oil-tanks just inside the harbour 
        were ablaze, and you could identify Dunkirk from the Thames estuary by 
        the huge pall of black smoke rising straight up in a windless sky. Our 
        ships were being bombed by enemy areoplanes up to about half-way across 
        the Channel and the troops on the beaches were suffering the same 
        attention. There were also German aircraft inland strafing the remnants 
        of the British Expeditionary Force fighting their way out to the 
        port.</FONT> </P>
        <P>&nbsp;</P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><B><FONT color=#8080ff>(3) 
        Douglas Bader first began to fly a </FONT><FONT color=#000000><A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWhurricane.htm">Hawker 
        Hurricane</A></FONT> <FONT color=#8080ff>in June, 1940 when he became 
        squadron leader of 242 Fighter Squadron.</FONT></B></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Hurricane was slower 
        than the Spitfire, with a maximum speed of 335 mph against 367 mph. The 
        Hurricane also was less elegant to the eye, but then there has never 
        been such a beautiful areoplane as the Spitfire. For all that, like 
        other fighters from the Hawker stable, and the result of the design 
        genius of Sydney Camm, the Hurricane was a thoroughbread and looked it. 
        Like the Spitfire it was immensely strong: a pilot had no need to fear 
        the danger of pulling the wings off, no matter how desperate the 
        situation became.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When I first flew the 
        Hurricane in June 1940, I was agreeably surprised at the compact feel of 
        the aeroplane. It had seemed big on the ground in comparison with the 
        Spitfire; in the air it felt nothing of the sort. You could see out of 
        it better and the controls were perfectly harmonized. It climbed steeply 
        and at a lower speed but required a good deal of right rudder in the 
        climb, to counteract the engine torque. I found this a considerable 
        nuisance on a long climb. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Like all pilots who flew 
        and fought in the Hurricane, I grew to love it. It was strong, highly 
        maneuverable, could turn inside the Spitfire and of course the Me 109. 
        Best of all, it was a marvellous gun platform. The sloping nose gave you 
        a splendid forward view, while the eight guns were set in blocks of four 
        in each wing, close to the fuselage. The aeroplane remained rock steady 
        when you fired. Unlike the Spitfire with its lovely elliptical wing 
        which sloped towards the tip, the Hurricane wing was thicker and 
        straight. The Spitfire was less stead when the guns were firing because, 
        I have always thought, they were spread further along the wing, and the 
        recoil effect was noticeable.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The advantage of the 
        Spitfire and the Hurricane in individual combat with the Me 109 was that 
        both British aeroplanes could out-turn the German one which was why, 
        when surprised from behind, the enemy's defensive manoeuvre was to push 
        the stick forward into a dive which, in 1940, we could not follow. If we 
        were surprised, our defence was to turn quickly and keep turning because 
        the Me 109's radius of turn was bigger than that of a Spitfire or 
        Hurricane and thus he could not keep you in his sights. If he was 
        inexperienced enough to try, he would find the British fighter behind 
        him after a couple of circuits. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nevertheless, the Me 109 
        was a good fighter in which the pilot and rear-gunner sat in tandem. It 
        took little punishment and was easy to shoot down, because it was 
        lightly built for performance. A burst from eight machine guns destroyed 
        it quickly. It wasn't anything like so manoeuvrable as a single-engined, 
        single-seater fighter and relied entirely on surprise to shoot us 
        down.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Focke-Wulf 190 
        certainly gave the British a shock. 1941 had ended with the Me 109 with 
        the Spitfire (two cannons and four machine-guns fighting it out on 
        fairly even terms. Then, without warning from British intelligence 
        sources, this startling aeroplane appeared in March 1942. A 
        radial-engineered fighter, it out-climbed and out-dived the Spitfire. 
        Now for the first time the Germans were out-flying our pilots. Instantly 
        Rolls and Supermarine retaliated with the Spitfire IXa which equalled 
        the 190, followed at the spring of 1942 with the IXa which equalled the 
        190, followed at the end of 1942 with the IXb which outflew it in all 
        respects. The Spitfire was unchallenged for the rest of the war, except 
        in the last few months by the Messerschmitt 262 jet which arrived too 
        late to make a significant contribution.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As always, when things like 
        this occur, one's mind remains clear. I pulled the little rubber ball 
        above my head which jettisoned the cockpit canopy and away it went. 
        Immediately things became rough and noisy with the wind roaring past and 
        around the now open cockpit. I was held by my harness and I had no 
        difficulty in moving my hands. I thought I might have difficulty in 
        getting out of the cockpit in this attitude of the aeroplane and at this 
        great speed. I pulled the harness pin, and it was as though I was sucked 
        out by a large vacuum cleaner to the accompaniment of tremendous noise 
        and buffeting. My helmet and goggles were wrenched off my head and then 
        to my final discomfort I found myself attached to my Spitfire, but 
        outside it. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ground below was the 
        farm and grazing land of northern France. A man wearing a peaked sort of 
        railway porter's cap and a blue smock, carrying on his shoulders a yoke 
        to which were attached two buckets, was opening a gate between two grass 
        fields. A woman with a scarf was with him. As he opened the gate, he 
        noticed me about 800 feet above and in front of him. They both remained 
        motionless, staring. I then realized my appearance was a bit odd. My 
        right leg was no longer with me. It had caught somewhere in the top of 
        the cockpit as I tried to leave my Spitfire. </FONT></P>
