        responsible offended against many of the principles of chivalry in 
        warfare as well as the tradition of dogged determination embodied in the 
        concept of the thin red line. Guerrillas were instructed not to 
        undertake an operation unless certain of success, to ensure that a good 
        line of retreat was always available, and never to engage in a pitched 
        battle unless in overwhelming strength. They were advised to use women 
        and children as couriers because they were less likely to be stopped and 
        searched. Among targets recommended were cinemas in which occupation 
        troops were being entertained, as they would be highly inflammable. 
        Instructions were given in the use of the various explosives then 
        available - ammonal, gelignite and dynamite - with detailed calculations 
        of the quantities required to destroy railways, bridges and buildings. 
        Informers in the service of the enemy must, it was pointed out firmly, 
        be killed promptly and, if possible, a note was to be pinned to the body 
        explaining the reasons for death.<BR></FONT><FONT

        quickly learned that the courage, endurance and pugnacity of the 
        patriots living in occupied territory were in direct proportion to the 
        brutality of the occupying force's repressive measures. No occupying 
        power can break the spirit and blunt the retaliatory power of a 
        patriotic and proud people. Conversely, no occupied country can take 
        really effective action against an occupying power without aid from 
        outside. Coordination of effort was essential, for uncoordinated 
        sabotage contributes but little to the destruction of the occupying 
        power's potential. It merely invites reprisals, which in turn provoke 
        further retaliation by the patriots. But if the occupied people feels 
        that it is being neglected or left in the lurch by its allies, if it 
        begins to listen and, by the force of repetition, to accept as truth the 
        enemy's propaganda, the reaction becomes more and more feeble, until it 
        finally peters out. <BR></FONT></P>

        May, 1945)</FONT></B><BR><BR>Since I assumed the Supreme Command in 
        January 1944, until the present day, its work has been marked by patient 
        and far-sighted planning, flexible adaptation to the operational 
        requirements of Supreme Headquarters, and efficient executive action 
        during operations.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In no previous war, and in 
        no other theatre during this war, have resistance forces been so closely 
        harnessed to the main military effort. While no final assessment of the 
        operational value of resistance action has yet been completed, I 
        consider that the disruption of enemy rail communications, the harassing 
        of German road moves and the continual and increasing strain placed on 
        the German war economy and internal security services throughout 
        occupied Europe by the organized forces of resistance, played a very 
        considerable part in our complete and final victory.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The combination of certain 
        sections of your two organizations, first established as Special Force 
        Headquarters under the joint command of Brigadier Mockler-Ferryman and 
        Colonel Haskell, was the means by which these resistance forces were so 
        ably organized, supplied and directed. Particular credit must be due to 
        those responsible for communications with occupied territory. I am also 
        aware of the care with which each individual country was studied and 
        organized, and of the excellent work carried out in training, 
        documenting", briefing and dispatching agents. The supply to agents and 
        resistance groups in the field, moreover, could only have reached such 
        proportions during the summer of 1944 through outstanding efficiency on 
        the part of the supply and air liaison staffs. Finally, I must express 
        my great admiration for the brave and often spectacular exploits of the 
        agents and special groups under control of Special Force 
        Headquarters.<BR><BR></FONT></P>
