        (1952)</FONT></B><BR><BR>It was not until March 1941 that my ambition to 
        become associated with the cause of French resistance could be realized. 
        I was on the point of leaving for the Middle East with my divisional 
        headquarters when a posting was received for me to join a secret 
        organization in the War Office. I reported on 17 March, 1941, to the 
        headquarters of this branch and found, to my delight, that I was 
        appointed to the newly formed French Section, whose duty it was to be to 
        'stir the torpid Frenchman' and 'to set Europe ablaze', to quote Mr. 
        Churchill's own definitions. </FONT></P>

        Howarth</A> worked for the <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWsoe.htm">Special 
        Operations Executive</A> during the <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WW.htm">Second World War</A> 
        and afterwards wrote about Maurice Buckmaster in his book, 
        <I>Undercover</I> (1980)</FONT></B><BR><BR>A tall man, with a gentle, 
        slightly self-deprecatory manner and eyes which, later in his life, 
        suggested he had seen nearly everything, Buckmaster was thought by some 
        to lack the ruthlessness which a perfectionist might have demanded. No 
        serious person ever doubted his dedication or his awareness of what was 
        owing to his agents in the field.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">He worked on average some 
        eighteen hours a day. He sometimes had an evening break, when he would 
        cycle home to Chelsea for an early dinner, returning to Baker Street 
        about 8 p.m. and usually remaining<BR>there until about 4 a.m. When 
        considering, after the war, a complaint that the records kept by F 
        Section were somewhat incomplete, he commented that those who finished 
        work at any time between three<BR>and five in the morning felt 'little 
        desire to tabulate the events of the day in order to earn the gratitude 
        of some hypothetical historian of the future'.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Buckmaster was deeply aware 
        of the importance of mutual trust between himself and agents who were 
        being sent on missions in which they would feel lonely, would be thrown 
        on their own resources, and<BR>would almost certainly begin to doubt 
        whether those in offices at home understood or even greatly cared about 
        their problems. He made a point of presenting agents, as they were about 
        to depart for the field, with a personal gift - gold cuff-links or a 
        gold cigarette-case - which had of course no British markings and which 
        would serve as a reminder that the agent was not forgotten. </FONT></P>

        Maurice Buckmaster, <I>They Fought Alone 
        </I>(1959)</FONT></B><BR><BR>Often I would go down together with others 
        from headquarters and would cross-question recruits, taking on the roles 
        of Gestapo men, in order to try and break their cover-stories. By this 
        means the story itself would become ingrained in their minds and they 
        themselves would gain some small idea of the rigours of interrogation. 
        If they survived without cracking, their confidence would be greatly 
        increased and they could face the thought of genuine German 
        interrogation in the knowledge that they had already withstood a similar 
        grilling successfully. These rehearsals were grim affairs and we spared 
        the recruits nothing. They were stripped and made to stand for hours in 
        the light of bright lamps and though, of<BR>course, we never used any 
        physical violence on them, they certainly knew what it was to go through 
        it by the time we<BR>had finished. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If they cracked badly under 
        the strain, it was tolerably sure that we would not send them, for it 
        was clear that a man who caved in when questioned by H.Q. staff, in 
        however realistic conditions, would be only too likely to wilt in the 
        face of the Boches. A minor slip would not be held against a man, but 
        too general a collapse most certainly would; we derived no pleasure, I 
        need hardly say, from those occasions when our cruel jibes, our 
        reiterated and shouted questions and our implacable persistence broke a 
        man's spirit, but we could console ourselves with the fact that his 
        cracking at a rehearsal might well have saved his life - and others - by 
        preventing the possibility of his doing the same thing with<BR>the 
        enemy. We were not playing a game.</FONT></P>

        Maurice Buckmaster, <I>They Fought Alone </I>(1959)</FONT></B><BR><BR>As 
        the number of our agents increased from a meagre seven in 1941 to fifty 
        by the middle of 1942 and one hundred and twenty by June, 1943, so we in 
        Baker Street were able to plan more and more ambitious and destructive 
        raids against the German supply machine. By February of 1944, at the 
        stage of some of our most important work, we had two hundred agents in 
        the field - many of them veterans of more than one tour of duty - all 
        either in liaison with large sections of Marquisards or acting as 
        wireless operators. On D-day itself, there were two hundred and twenty 
        agents putting into effect the plans which we relayed to them from 
        Headquarters in Baker Street. In all, four hundred and eighty active 
        agents were employed by the French section of S.O.E. From uncertainty 
        even as to its purpose, the section grew to be a confident and deadly 
        fighting force.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">By the beginning of 1943 we 
        had managed to organize ourselves in a manner which was to set the 
        pattern for the duration of the war. We had our headquarters in Baker 
        Street where all operations were planned and where intelligence was 
        collated and filed and where new reports from agents in the field were 
        received. We held our briefing sessions at a flat in Orchard Court, not 
        far away. Here men who were about to be dropped into France were given 
        the latest details about conditions, both generally and as they affected 
        their own particular districts. It might be that a certain operator was 
        suspected of working with the Germans. We would warn the outgoing agent 
        and tell him in what circumstances he should take appropriate action to 
        silence the man. <BR><BR><BR></FONT></P>

        needed to British agents to occupied France. </FONT></B><BR><BR>We 
        quickly learned that the courage, endurance and pugnacity of the 
        patriots living in occupied territory were in direct proportion to the 
        brutality of the occupying force's repressive measures. No occupying 
        power can break the spirit and blunt the retaliatory power of a 
        patriotic and proud people. Conversely, no occupied country can take 
        really effective action against an occupying power without aid from 
        outside. Coordination of effort was essential, for uncoordinated 
        sabotage contributes but little to the destruction of the occupying 
        power's potential. It merely invites reprisals, which in turn provoke 
        further retaliation by the patriots. But if the occupied people feels 
        that it is being neglected or left in the lurch by its allies, if it 
        begins to listen and, by the force of repetition, to accept as truth the 
        enemy's propaganda, the reaction becomes more and more feeble, until it 
        finally peters out. <BR></FONT></P>

        war, to blame the Maquis for every misfortune and hardship that France 
        has now to undergo. It is almost an unpopular thing in France in 1952 to 
        have fought for France's liberation in 1940-45. And if one fought and 
        perhaps died in company with British officers, it is now considered 
        almost unpardonable. None of the 'best people' did it. Of course, they 
        were not collaborationists - nor supporters of Petain - just the best 
        type that waited to see what would happen. I wonder what, in fact, would 
        have happened if all these brave men and women who continually risked 
        life and property to save our liaison officers had waited on the 
        fence?</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A rather similar and 
        equally unfounded prejudice also exists in France today. It is that the 
        members of the French resistance groups were nearly all Communists or, 
        at any rate, that the Communist groups - the FTP (Franc-tireurs et 
        Partisans) and the Front National - were the only groups to do any 
        effective work. This theory is strongly advanced by Communist 
        propaganda, but I can say with authority that, so far as the groups were 
        concerned who worked with British liaison officers, we were only 
        interested in their patriotism and their ability to carry out such 
        tasks, and not at all in their political opinions.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In all, during the period 
        March 1941 to July 1944, we recruited over 460 male and 40 female 
        officers for work in the field. It has always seemed to me surprising 
        that there were so many British or Dominion subjects, whose French was 
        faultless, willing and anxious to undertake such supremely dangerous 
        work. They were in no way conspicuous; the last thing we wanted in them 
        was eccentricity. We denied them glamour, in their own interests; we 
        made them look as homely and unremarkable as we could. In the words of 
        one of them, they were 'just ordinary people, not particularly 
        brave'.</FONT></P>

        (1952)</FONT></B><BR></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As the war progressed and 
        supplies improved, we were able to send out by parachute to our 
        operators a fair quantity of radio transmitters, cunningly camouflaged, 
        and they were bidden to jettison or abandon sets whose use might seem to 
        them particularly dangerous. The care with which our agents treated 
        their sets was demonstrated to me in no uncertain manner after the war, 
        when, in my travels round the areas where our people had been working, I 
        was handed the jealously guarded suitcases containing transmitters - 
        'still in perfect working order', I was assured.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">It was evidently essential 
        to relieve, as much as we could, the burden of traffic over the 
        'clandestine air'. We quickly realized the possibility of using the BBC 
        French Service for sending out previously arranged conventional 
        messages. This system eliminated the need for the intricate coding and 
        decoding which was necessary in sending our Morse messages. For there 
        were many occasions on which a prearranged signal, totally meaningless 
        to the enemy, gave an agent the clue for which he was 
waiting.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The simplest example was 
        the use of a harmless-sounding phrase on the French programme of the 
        BBC, to confirm, as arranged with the agent, that a parachute operation 
        was scheduled for that night. It was possible to send over the air from 
        Bush House studios at 7.30 p.m. a message. 'Nanette porte un pyjama 
        vert', or some other such nonsense, which meant to the initiated 
        reception committee approximately this: 'The aircraft which you asked 
        for, parachuting stores as arranged on such and such a ground, is 
        scheduled for tonight. If there is no setback in the weather, if the 
        pilot finds the field you should see the containers floating down to you 
        in x hours from now.' A further message on the 9.15 programme confirmed 
        the operation again (or, by the absence of such message, intimated to 
        the listeners that for some reason or other the operation had been 
        'scrubbed'). In winter, when aircraft frequently left their bases before 
        9 p.m., the message at 9.15 literally meant that the load was on its 
        way, and constituted an imperative order to the reception committee to 
        get out to the chosen field with all haste. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When it came to choosing 
        conventional messages for subsequent use on the BBC, the boys and girls 
        were surprisingly enterprising. Quotations from the classics alternated 
        with jests, sometimes in dubious taste - so dubious that we feared to 
        propose them to the austere authorities of Bush House.</FONT></P>
