        re-reading your last letters I got in England. In them you complain that 
        you<BR>have seen no action as yet. When I left England you had already 
        been abroad 18 months, but already out here in Sicily I have seen more 
        than enough. You have missed nothing worthwhile and even if your present 
        life is dull (it may be very different now) stick to it and try to come 
        out of this bloody war alive and unmaimed. That is all that really 
        matters. Not medals, Africa stars and all that cock. It is your brains 
        that we want after the war, not your decorations. </FONT>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You also lament the lack of 
        anything better than a hurricane lamp to light your mess with. Well, we 
        have no mess and no lamps, nor are we likely to have either for a long 
        time. We have been eating by night and living in holes dug in the ground 
        full of ants, fleas, lice, flies, mosquitoes, wasps, and a lot more, and 
        as a result my body is one mass of festering sores and bites and I am 
        swathed in bandages. My face is daubed with some purple muck and I 
        cannot shave. For weeks at a time we have not even taken our boots off, 
        let alone undressed, and two hours is a good night's sleep. We have been 
        sweating in a climate as hot as Africa and when dead a man and a cow 
        smell alike. The foulest smell on earth.</FONT></P>

        Roly, How I wish I could spare you our sad news, but we share everything 
        together. Ivor was killed in action on Monday Aug. 9th. He wrote to you 
        last of all. His last to us was on the 4th. I hope it was all 
        instantaneous. The news came this morning from the War Office, and 
        although we had been very anxious this last week, it came as a stunning 
        blow. Ever since the broadcast by Lewis Hastings a week or more ago, 
        when he told us of the heavy casualties in the D.L.I. C Coy and the 
        tremendous stand they had made and gave them such praise, our fears have 
        been growing, but<BR>we have gone on hoping for good news. He was so 
        thoughtful and wrote whenever he had the chance, and cabled once. It 
        seems like a dream somehow. We can't do anything but face as bravely as 
        we can this sorrow. Perhaps Ivor is saved further horror of war, for 
        after Sicily who knows? We must not grieve for him, only that his happy 
        and promising life is cut short. I feel so stunned and dare not think of 
        details. I just give thanks for the beautiful 21 years we have had him. 
        Ivor's love for you has been very great and it's been such a happiness 
        to us that you were both such friends. I know how sad and lonely you 
        will feel. It's a very great shock, and I feel more for you than I can 
        tell you. Ivor would not have us grieve, so let us only give thanks for 
        happy memories, and then carry on. I am so distressed that Ivor never 
        had any letters after he left England. They might have helped him. If we 
        have any particulars we will tell you. We decided not to cable; it 
        serves no purpose, and letters are about as quick. </FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I am writing to send you 
        all my sympathy and that of the Battalion for the tragic loss you have 
        sustained in the death of your son. He was killed leading his platoon - 
        the forward platoon of the leading company in the Battalion just outside 
        the village of Riposto. On rounding a bend in the road they were 
        surprised by an enemy machine gun at fifty yards range. With no cover 
        available nearby he was caught in the enemy fire, and I am glad to say 
        can have known nothing of it. His C.S.M. was killed alongside him, and 
        his Company Commander badly wounded just behind. It was a very cleverly 
        concealed ambush and no fault of the platoon or their leaders. He was 
        buried where he fell.</FONT></P>
