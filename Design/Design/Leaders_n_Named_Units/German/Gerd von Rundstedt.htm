        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Germany.htm">Germany</A>, on 
        12th December 1875. He joined the <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWWgerman.htm">German 
        Army</A> and served throughout the <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/FWW.htm">First World War</A>. 
        By 1918 he had reached the rank of major and was chief of staff of his 
        division.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>After the war 
        Rundstedt rose steadily in the small 100,000 man army and in 1932 was 
        appointed commander of the 3rd Infantry Division. Later that year he 
        threatened to resign when <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERpapen.htm">Franz von 
        Papen</A> declared martial law and ordered his troops to eject members 
        of the <A href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERsdp.htm">Social 
        Democratic Party</A> from state government offices. However, Rundstedt 
        eventually agreed to carry out the task.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>In February 
        1934, Rundstedt joined with General <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERleeb.htm">Wilhelm Leeb</A> 
        to block the pro-Nazi <A

        Fitsch</A> when he was ousted after false claims were made about his 
        sexuality. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Rundstedt was 
        unhappy with the growing power of <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERhitler.htm">Adolf 
        Hitler</A> over the army and resigned from office on 31st October 1938. 
        Although 64 years old, Rundstedt was recalled to the army on the 
        outbreak of the <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WW.htm">Second World War</A> 
        and in September 1939 led Army Group South into <A

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>In 1940 
        Rundstedt was quick to see the merits of the plan devised by <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERmanstein.htm">Erich von 
        Manstein</A> to invade <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/France.htm">France</A>. With 
        his support the Manstein Plan was eventually used as part of the <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWwesternO.htm">Western 
        Offensive</A>. Rundstedt led seven panzer divisions, three motorized 
        divisions, and 35 infantry divisions during the invasion of <A

        </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>By 14th May, 
        1940, the German tanks led by General <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERguderian.htm">Heinz 
        Guderian</A> had crossed the Meuse and had opened up a a fifty-mile gap 
        in the Allied front. Rundstedt had doubts about the aggressive tactics 
        of Guderian and argued that his tanks should halt and wait until 
        infantry divisions could catch up. Rundsteadt did not fully understand 
        <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWblitzkreig.htm">Blitzkrieg</A> 
        tactics and wanted a conventional assault on the <A

        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERhitler.htm">Adolf

        </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Rundstedt was 
        promoted to field marshal on 19th July 1940 and took part in the 
        planning of <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWsealion.htm">Operation 
        Sealion</A>. When the invasion of Britain was called off Rundstedt took

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>In June 1941 
        Rundsdet took part in <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSbarbarossa.htm">Operation 
        Barbarossa</A> when as commander of Army Group South he led 52 infantry

        campaign. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>In September 
        1941, Rundsdet took part in the capture of Kiev where 665,000 Russian 
        prisoners were taken. After this he moved east to attack Kharkov and 
        Rostov.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>Rundsdet 
        strongly opposed continuing the advance into the <A

        during the winter. He advised <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERhitler.htm">Adolf 
        Hitler</A> to call a halt but his views were rejected. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>At the 
        beginning of November 1941, Rundsdet had a heart-attack. However, he 
        refused to be hospilized and continued the advance and reached Rostov on 
        21st November, but a <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/RUSred.htm">Red Army</A> 
        counter-attack forced the Germans back. Hitler was furious and blamed 
        Rundsdet for the defeat. When Rundsdet demanded he should be allowed to 
        withdraw he was sacked and replaced by General <A 
        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/GERreichenau.htm">Walther von

        href="http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/France.htm">France</A> where 
        he was given reponsibility of defending the Atlantic coast. Known as the 
        Atlantic Wall, Rundsdet organized the building of permanent 
        fortifications with huge naval guns along 1,700 miles of 
        coastline.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color=#000000>After the <A

        steps to prepare for an invasion were taken only after the French 
        capitulation, no definite date could be fixed when the plan was drafted. 
        It depended on the time required to provide the shipping, to alter ships 
        so they could carry tanks, and to train the troops in embarking and 
        disembarking. The invasion was to be made in August if possible, and 
        September at the latest. The military reasons for its cancellation were 
        various. The German Navy would have had to control the North Sea as well 
        as the Channel, and was not strong enough to do so. The German Air Force 
        was not sufficient to protect the sea crossing on its own. While the 
        leading part of the forces might have landed, there was the danger that 
        they might be cut off from supplies and reinforcements. </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The responsibility of 
        commanding the invasion fell to me, and the task was assigned to my Army 
        Group. The 16th Army under General Busch was on the right, and the 9th 
        Army under General Strauss was on the left. They were to sail from ports 
        stretching from Holland to Le Havre. The 16th Army was to use ports from 
        Antwerp to Boulogne, while the 9th Army was to use the ports between the 
        Somme and the Seine. No landing was to be made north of the 
        Thames.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We were then to push 
        forward and establish a much larger bridgehead along an arc south of 
        London. It ran up the south shore of the Thames to the outskirts of 
        London, and then south-westwards to Southampton Water.</FONT></P>

        face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">ong before winter came the chances 
        had been diminished owing to the repeated delays in the advance that 
        were caused by bad roads, and mud. The 'black earth' of the Ukraine 
        could be turned into mud by ten minutes rain - stopping all movement 
        until it dried. That was a heavy handicap in a race with time. If was, 
        increased by a lack of railways in Russia - for bringing up supplies to 
        our advancing troops. Another adverse factor was the way the Russians 
        received continual reinforcements from their back areas, as they fell 
        back. It seemed to us that as soon as one force was wiped out, the path 
        was blocked by the arrival of a fresh force.</FONT></P>

        and withdraw to the Mius River, Field-Marshal von Brauchitach agreed, 
        but men an overriding order came from the Fuhrer, which forbade any such 
        withdrawal. I wired back that it was nonsense to hold on where we were, 
        and added: "If you do not accept my view you must find someone else to 
        command." That same night a reply came from the Fuhrer that my 
        resignation was accepted - I left the Eastern Front on December 1st, and 
        never returned there. Almost immediately afterwards the Fuhrer flew down 
        to that sector; after seeing the situation, he changed his mind and 
        sanctioned the step-back. Significantly, the Mius River line was the 
        only sector of the front that was not taken during the winter of 
        1941-42.<BR></FONT></P>
