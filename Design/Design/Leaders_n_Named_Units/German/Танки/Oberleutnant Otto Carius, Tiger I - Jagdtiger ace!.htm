<p><span lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>OTTO CARIUS: Oberleutnant
Otto Carius of 2/ Kompanie Schwere Panzer Abteilung 502 <span class=GramE>was</span>
a Panzer warrior of memorable quality. This German Panzer Ace set standards of
courage and achievement. With at least 150 tank kill victories to his credit on
the Eastern front, he was awarded <span class=SpellE>Das</span> <span
class=SpellE>Eichenlaub</span> <span class=SpellE>zum</span> <span
class=SpellE>Ritterkreuz</span> des <span class=SpellE>Eisernen</span> <span
class=SpellE>Kreuzes</span> (The Knights Cross with Oak leaves). And he was
also the recipient of the rare tank battle badge in silver (<span class=SpellE>Panzerkampfabzeichen</span>)
for 100 engagements. Otto <span class=SpellE>Carius</span> most successful mission
was when he led his company of Tigers, the “<span class=SpellE>Carius</span> <span
class=SpellE>Kampfgruppen</span>” against an entire Russian tank brigade
equipped with the new Joseph Stalin II heavy tank. <span class=SpellE>Carius</span>
plan was to allow the Russians to close in, <span class=GramE>then</span>
ambush them by destroying the lead and the last vehicles to prevent the rest of
the tanks from escaping. Within half and hour the Tiger crews saw dust on the
horizon, then the column of tanks, there were numerous supply vehicles in the
column, and the tanks had their guns fully elevated, most of the tanks carried
infantry, and obviously the Russians did not expect to see combat in that area.
The lead tank crossed through the ambush zone, and <span class=SpellE>Carius</span>
gave the order to fire. The Tigers made short work of the exposed column,
destroying the entire Joseph Stalin tank brigade. The entire Soviet column was
a scene of complete chaos as fire and explosions erupted all along the line of
burning vehicles. 28 JS II heavy tanks were destroyed and numerous fuel and
ammunition trucks. Otto <span class=SpellE>Carius</span> became the tank
nemesis of the Soviets, they feared him, <span class=GramE>fame</span> and
accolades awarded the Soviet tanker who could bring back <span class=SpellE>Carius</span>
scalp. Squadrons of tanks were sent to nail him, none did, and he survived the
war to pass into both legend and history as one of the unforgettable tank men
of the conflict. The Otto <span class=SpellE>Carius</span> legend was taking
form, etched with fiery clarity in the Panzer battles on the Eastern Front. He
paid little heed to fog or adverse weather conditions, a lethal tank ghost with
a flaming touch. Supremely confident in his command of the Tiger tank, he could
lead his Tiger crew anywhere with him. He was the greatest of the “Lone Wolf”.
The five-man crew became a deadly combination in the Tiger tank. Teamwork
developed from a blend of hard experience and intuition that turned the Tiger
tank into a death-dealing wraith upon the Soviets. The heart, brain, and
inspiration of the combination <span class=GramE>was</span> Otto <span
class=SpellE>Carius</span>. His aggressive spirit could not be quenched while
there were masses of enemy tanks, he would violate orders to get at his foes. The
aggressive <span class=SpellE>Carius</span> began to ring up strings of
multiple tank kills, battling the Soviets at the summit of his powers. Otto <span
class=SpellE>Carius</span> was determined to reveal the capabilities of the
Tiger tank, of which he was the bearer and embodiment. Deep, abiding
patriotism, neither centered on nor anchored to ephemeral political regimes was
the foundation of his character. Service as an officer in the armed forces was
his tradition and his youthful goal, little else in life meant anything to him
but service to his nation. Otto <span class=SpellE>Carius</span> and his crew
developed an extremely potent morale, and this spirit quickly reflected in the
string of kills scored on the Eastern Front. Otto <span class=SpellE>Carius</span>
was unconquered by his enemies. Late in the war Otto <span class=SpellE>Carius</span>
was transferred to the west and eventually commanded a company of Hunting
Tigers in <span class=SpellE>Jagdtiger</span> <span class=SpellE>Abteilung</span>
512. The men commanding these <span class=SpellE>Jagdtigers</span> were </span><st1:country-region><st1:place><span
  lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>Germany</span></st1:place></st1:country-region><span
lang=EN-US style='mso-ansi-language:EN-US'>’s premium. The feeling of
confidence, superiority, and invincibility that the <span class=SpellE>Jagdtigers</span>
gave its crews caused their morale to zoom even in the final days of the war. In
battling allied armor, the <span class=SpellE>Jagdtiger</span> was superior to
anything sent against it. The <span class=SpellE>Jagdtiger</span> was an
armored weapon of multiple virtues. Superbly effective against the allied
streams of tanks, its heavy armor and armament was a relative immunity to
allied armor that did great physical and morale damage to the enemy. Crowning
its virtues, the <span class=SpellE>Jagdtiger</span> restored and fortified
German tank morale and depressed that of the enemy. No tanker under his command
was asked to do anything that Otto <span class=SpellE>Carius</span> had not
already done himself. Such was the breadth of his experience. In hundreds of
land battles in five and a half years of war, he had flirted and escaped death
at the hands of the allies and the soviets whose purpose was to kill him. Against
all odds he survived the war. His outstanding military feats earned him a
permanent place in the history of armored combat. Indeed, a Panzer warrior of
memorable quality and a true Knight of Steel. <o:p></o:p></span><!--EndFreetext--></p>
