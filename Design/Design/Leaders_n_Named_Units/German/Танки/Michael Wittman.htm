      border=0>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The First World War made cavalry and 
      traditional infantry tactics obsolete; it also cemented the existence of 
      long-range artillery, the machine gun, and complex defensive positions as 
      key ingredients for conventional war.&nbsp; So horrific and hard-earned 
      were the lessons of the Western Front that countries, especially France, 
      sought to create a modern army to deal with any potential encounters with 
      their bothersome neighbor, on the off chance that it may again one day 
      wage war.&nbsp; But while the victors redrafted the blueprints of their 
      armed forces to fight a repeat of The Great War, the Germans were 
      preparing to fight the war of the future, which would heavily rely on an 
      experimental weapon considered a mere novelties by many archaic generals: 
      the tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like its aquatic 
      cousin, the submarine, the tank in itself was not a new invention, but 
      through adaptation of the mammoth-like machines used twenty years before, 
      European engineers (working for companies such as BMW and Porsche) created 
      improved models that called for new offensive strategies.&nbsp; These 
      strategies promised quick, decisive movement on the frontlines. Yet, in 
      order to produce victories with these new machines, men of extraordinary 
      talent and nerve were needed to commandeer the vehicles.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; World War II would 
      prove to be the greatest tank war of them all. And during the brief period 
      in history that tanks would serve as a determining factor on the 
      battlefield, the greatest of all tank unit leaders would come from this 
      war. This man would be Michael Wittman.&nbsp;&nbsp; </FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Michael Wittman was 
      born in rural Germany to a farm family in August of 1914.&nbsp; After 
      completing his mandatory RaD labor service in 1934, he returned to his 
      father’s farm, where he would continue to work in between stretches of 
      military service until 1937, whereupon he joined the elite LAH division, 
      the SS unit which bore Hitler’s name.&nbsp; In 1939, Wittman saw combat in 
      both Poland and Western Europe.&nbsp; Again in the thick of combat at the 
      outbreak of the Russian Campaign, he gained instant recognition with the 
      14<SUP>th</SUP> Corps after knocking out six tanks out of an eight-tank 
      entourage in a skirmish in the south sector of the front line. By November 
      of 1941, he had received the Iron Cross, Second Class, the Wound Badge and 
      the Close Combat Badge.&nbsp; His superiors recognized an obvious prodigy 
      in their midst, and sent him off to an officer school in Bavaria.&nbsp; By 
      December of 1942, Wittman was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 
      13<SUP>th</SUP> Korps of Panzer Regiment 1, and was back on the front 
      lines with the new Panzer tank.&nbsp; He displayed his incredible skills 
      at the Battle of Kursk, where he knocked out 30 Soviet tanks and 28 
      artillery pieces.&nbsp; In another single day of combat over the same 
      summer, he claimed 10 more tanks, bringing his total somewhere in the 
      vicinity of 60 tanks.&nbsp; In January of 1944, Wittman led his Panzer 
      unit in an amazing battle that halted an entire Soviet tank brigade.&nbsp; 
      For this Wittman received the Knight’s Cross, then shortly afterwards, the 
      Oakleaves to his knight’s cross, coming along with it a telegraph from 
      Hitler, giving more than the usual round of praise.&nbsp; Wittman was once 
      again promoted and given command of Panzer Troop 501.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It so happened that 
      his division, licking its wounds from the devastating combat on the 
      Eastern Front, were stationed in Normandy during the summer of 1944.&nbsp; 
      The chaotic conditions preceding the Allied landing </FONT><FONT 
      face=Arial size=2>meant that it was a full day before Wittman’s 
      </FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>unit were in the thick of combat, but their 
      late arrival on the front lines were quickly made up for.&nbsp; Leading 
      only a small detachment of armor, he met up with a British tank unit at a 
      small village, wh</FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2>ere he quickly knocked out 
      the four opposing machines. Regrouping with the </FONT><FONT face=Arial 
      size=2>main force, he then struck out to find a column of 25 armored 
      units. By knocking out the front and the rear tank, Wittman bought enough 
      time to destroy the remainder of the entire column. Support units would 
      capture 230 British soldiers from the melee, who were largely disoriented 
      from the amazing battle. Though his tank was destroyed during the 
      subsequent retreat, Wittman and crew managed to escape. Shortly 
      thereafter, he was awarded Swords to his Knight’s Cross.&nbsp; 
      Single-handedly, Wittman destroyed the bulk of the British 22<SUP>nd 
      </SUP>&nbsp;Armoured Brigade and saved his own division from sure 
      destruction.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time Wittman 
      had destroyed nearly 140 tanks and almost as many anti-tank pieces. He was 
      promoted to captain and offered a position at a tank school, but preferred 
      to stay with his unit.&nbsp; So far-reaching was his fame that even Allied 
      soldiers were frightened at the thought of going up against any Panzer, 
      let alone one under the command of the German farmer. But Wittman’s life 
      would not last much longer.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By August 
      8<SUP>th</SUP>, the situation in France had turned desperate.&nbsp; His 
      tank unit, now regrouped with the impressive 12<SUP>th</SUP> SS Division, 
      met up with Canadian armor at Cintheaux. Though the town itself was 
      recaptured and the Canadians, (unsurprisingly) sustained heavy casualties, 
      the German high command considered the battle a tremendous blow, for 
      Wittman was lost.&nbsp; Like a knight making his last stand, Wittman 
      perished in a combat engagement with a detachment of the 4<SUP>th</SUP> 
      Canadian Armored Division against overwhelming odds.&nbsp; Five tanks 
      caught the ace’s Panzer in the open on August 8<SUP>th</SUP>, 1944 in the 
      French countryside. and in the ensuing match that followed, Wittman and 
      his entire crew were killed.&nbsp; Wittman was reported missing the 
      following day, a demoralizing defeat for his division and the entire 
      German army. The whereabouts of his body would remain a mystery for over 
      40 years, until an accidental discovery by a French road crew led to the 
      exhumation and identification of Wittman’s corpse.</FONT></P>
      <P><FONT face=Arial size=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike many German 
      tank men, whose reputation was that of arrogance and overconfidence, 
      Wittman was known for his quiet, mild-mannered behavior, even under fire. 
      It is true that Michael Wittman’s overwhelming success during the 
      tooth-and-nail fighting in Normandy partially came from the gross 
      imbalance of tank quality.&nbsp; The Tiger tank, while a mediocre 
      offensive weapon, proved to be excellent for the defensive strategy of the 
      German army, with its powerful cannon and heavy armor.&nbsp; The American 
      Sherman and the British Cromwell proved to be too light-armored for such 
      heavy close-range fighting, and its firepower was no match against German 
      guns.&nbsp; What had given these two machines a distinct advantage in 
      North Africa became a crux in Western Europe. It should also be remembered 
      that the German tank crews were seasoned veterans almost to a man, whereas 
      many of the American crews had never been in combat before. These 
      advantages would be helpful in the hands of most tank commanders.&nbsp; In 
      the hands of Michael Wittman, he was practically invincible.&nbsp; Michael 
      Wittman was permanently laid to rest at a military cemetery in La 
      Cambe.&nbsp; Balthus Woll, his former gunner and another Knights Cross 
      recipient, lived long enough to see the body discovered and given a proper 
      burial.</FONT></P>
