        anti-tank gunfire at intervals during the drive to Avesnes, which I

        near us. </FONT></P>

        often a look out of the hatch to assure myself that there was still no

        </FONT></B></FONT></B></FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">One of the most fascinating 
        studies of the last war was the contrast between these two great 
        commanders, Montgomery and Rommel, each in his own way an outstanding 
        general, yet utterly and absolutely different in almost every respect. 
        Rommel was probably the best armoured corps commander produced by either 
        side. Utterly fearless, full of drive and initiative, he was always up 
        in front where the battle was fiercest. If his opponent made a mistake, 
        Rommel was on to it like a flash, and he never hesitated to take 
        personal command of a regiment or battalion if he thought fit. On one 
        occasion he was found lifting mines with his own hands. His popularity 
        with the soldiers was immense, but a great many officers resented his 
        interference with their commands.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">All this reads like the 
        copybook general but, in point of fact, this is not the best way to 
        control a swift-moving, modern battle. Very often at a critical moment 
        no one could find Rommel, because he was conducting personally some 
        battalion attack. He tended to become so involved in some minor action 
        that he failed to appreciate the general picture of the battlefield. 
        </FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Monty was not such a 
        dashing, romantic figure as his opponent; nor would you find him leading 
        a forlorn hope in person, for the simple reason that if he was in 
        command forlorn hopes did not occur. He had an extraordinary capacity 
        for putting his finger straight on the essentials of any problem, and of 
        being able to explain them simply and clearly. He planned all his 
        battles most carefully - and then put them out of his mind every night. 
        I believe he was awakened in the night only half a dozen times during 
        the whole war.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Their handling of the 
        battle of Alam Haifa makes the contrast clear. Having made the best 
        possible plan to win the battle, yet at the same time to husband his 
        resources, Monty dismissed Alam Haifa entirely from his mind and 
        concentrated on the next one.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">While Rommel was leading 
        his troops in person against strongly-held defensive positions on the 
        Alam Halfa ridge, Montgomery was planning the battle of Alamein. That 
        was the difference between the two. </FONT></P>

        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Many of the soldiers I 
        talked to had taken part in victorious advances which had led them to 
        Benghazi and beyond, and had then been pushed back: for months, of 
        course, the desert campaign had been a see-saw between the Eighth Army 
        and the Afrika Korps. And the final result of this contest of arms, when 
        I arrived in Cairo, was, as I have said, that we were back on the final 
        ditch of resistance.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During these conversations 
        I detected, not unexpectedly, a belief that Field-Marshal Rommel, who 
        had commanded the<BR>German forces in Africa since their first arrival 
        in February 1941, was a wizard of the battlefield: his publicity 
        build-up had been enormous. There is no question that the Field-Marshal 
        was a most able battle commander and a fine tactician for an independent 
        force like the Afrika Korps, but it was hardly necessary to attribute to 
        him preternatural gifts in order to explain his successes.</FONT></P>
        <P><FONT face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Incidentally, he was a very 
        chivalrous enemy. I am told that when he took wounded prisoners he would 
        go round the hospitals and praise them for having put up a good show, 
        thereby sustaining and extending, no doubt, the Rommel 
legend.</FONT></P>
