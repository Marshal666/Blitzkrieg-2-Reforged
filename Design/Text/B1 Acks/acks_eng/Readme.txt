Blitzkrieg - German/English voice overs - Effective Media
44/16/mono unprocessed .wav - 02-12-2002

Directory information:
\44_16_M contains all VOs in full quality

The VO file names and folders are according to the script "g_acks_eng.xls".
We had to change and update many file names as you used some filenames twice while
some roles have been mixed etc. All changes to those filenames have been highlighted
in red in the column "Old wrong Filename" while you can find the correct name right
next to it in our new column "Correct Filename".

The English train is with the French accent as you wanted it to be.
